Abstract: The principal objective of the present research involved the achievement of high biodegradation degrees of perﬂuorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perﬂuorosulfonic acid (PFOS) using pure
individual bacterial strains. The use of such microorganisms can contribute to the improvement of the
wastewater treatment process in sewage treatment plants through bioaugmentation or other bioremediation processes. Thus, in this study, we investigated the biodegradation potential of PFOA and
PFOS. Bacterial strains tested in this study were from the Pseudomonas genus, namely: Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida, due to their known capacity to degrade xenobiotic compounds.
The results indicated that Pseudomonas aeruginosa was able to transform 27.9% of PFOA and 47.3% of
PFOS in 96 h, while Pseudomonas putida managed to transform 19.0% of PFOA and 46.9% of PFOS
in the same time frame. During the biodegradation tests, PFHxA was recognized as the principal
biotransformation product of PFOA in the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and PFPeA, PFPxA
and PFHpA were recognized as the biotransformation products in the presence of Pseudomonas
putida. For PFOS, only two biotransformation products (PHHxA and PFHpA) were observed as a
consequence of biodegradation by both bacterial strains.
Keywords: PFOA; PFOS; pseudomonas strains; biodegradation; kinetics; biotransformation products
1. Introduction
Perﬂuoroalkyl and polyﬂuoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are recognized being highly
difﬁcult organic contaminants to treat in aquatic ecosystems [1]. PFAS are used widely
in a variety of customer products. For this reason, these substances are considered to be
omnipresent in the environment and are highly persistent. Perﬂuorooctanoic acid (PFOA)
and perﬂuorosulfonic acid (PFOS) are two of the most common PFAS; they have been
extensively produced and can also be obtained by degradation processes of various precursors. PFOS and PFOA were found in many environmental compartments and represent
a great concern for both biota and human health [2,3]. The negative effects of PFOA and
PFOS on the wildlife and humans could be summarized in the wide distribution, huge
persistence, bioaccumulation predisposition and potential toxicological repercussions [4–7].
Therefore, ﬁnding new biodegradation methods for destruction of these organic pollutants represents a matter of increasing necessity, as does considering economically and
eco-friendly methods.
In spite of the initial discouraging experimental data regarding the biodegradability of
PFAS under environmental conditions, because of their high resistance, scientists continued
to analyze different microorganisms for their ability to degrade PFAS. In the last decade, several studies discovered that different single or mixed microbial types were able to degrade
some PFAS compounds, such as perﬂuorinated alkyl acids (PFAA), PFOA and PFOS [8–12].

The cases where biodegradation has been successful have created opportunities for biological treatment with PFAS, although the transformation depends on the systemic intricacy of
the PFAS species, the microscopic organism types and the environmental circumstances.
It is well known that the carbon–ﬂuoride covalent bond is one of the strongest in
organic chemistry. For this reason, the direct enzymatic action and microbial degradation of
such substances are hard to accomplish [13,14]. Even so, some recent studies have showed
that naturally existing microorganisms’ own enzymes could break the carbon–ﬂuoride
bonds in normal conditions (25 ◦C and neutral pH) [15–17]. Moreover, some bacteria strains
can catalyze the splitting of the C-F bond through reductive [17–19], oxygenolytic [20],
hydration [21] and hydrolytic [22] mechanisms.
Studies on this topic have reported that bacterial species degrade PFAS in the presence
or absence of oxygen (Table 1). Almost all of the accessible studies present the biodegradation of PFAS compounds using different cultures isolated from solid environmental
compartments (soil, sludge or sediments) [23–25]. Biodegradability studies of PFAS and
ﬂuorotelomer species using bacterial strains were predominantly communicated in the
preceding literature. Following the biodegradability studies of some ﬂuorotelomers, using
activated sludge in the presence of free oxygen, it was observed that some similar major
products were obtained during the process, among them perﬂuorohexanoic acid (PFHxA)
and perﬂuoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) [23]. While limited ﬂuorinated PFAS compounds
are rapidly transformable under different microorganisms’ activities, completely ﬂuorinated species, such as PFOA and PFOS, have higher stability and were assumed to be
non-biodegradable [24,26,27].

Based on the low levels of PFAS substances in wastewater treatment plants’ efﬂuents,
both aerobic and anaerobic degradation of PFOA and PFOS were tested [28]. The data
revealed that none of the PFOA or PFOS were transformed under aerobic conditions; in
comparison, the anaerobic condition achieved almost maximum degradation of PFOA
and PFOS.

Pseudomonas sp. looks to be an appropriate candidate for the biodegradation treatment
of PFOA and PFOS, as well as for other similar compounds. The achievement of PFOS
biotransformation was communicated for the ﬁrst time in 2014, with up to 67% removal
efﬁciency [9]. The major biotransformation products of PFOS under Pseudomonas aeruginosa
strain HJ4 activity were perﬂuorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) and perﬂuorohexanesulfonic
acid (PFHxS) [9]. Pseudomonas plecoglossicida was later revealed to biotransform PFOS
with higher removal efﬁciency (up to 75% in soil and up to 100% in laboratory mineral
medium) [29]. In 2016, the bacterial strain Pseudomonas parafulva YAB1 was isolated from
soil contaminated with perﬂuorinated compounds, and it was shown to reduce PFOA
13–48% under laboratory conditions [10]. Recently, in 2019, the biological removal of PFAS
species using Acidimicrobium sp. Strain A6 proved to be an alternative biodegradation
technique of PFA compounds, using them as electron acceptors in the Feammox bacterial
procedure [8].
Recent research on PFAS biodegradation has demonstrated that the Gordonia sp. aerobic strain NB4-1Y could remove ﬂuorotelomer compounds with great efﬁciency (up to
88%) within 7 days [31]. In addition, Pseudomonas plecoglossicida 2.4-D was able to degrade
PFOS, obtaining perﬂuoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) as major biotransformation product, in
less than 6 days [29].
An important and well-known beneﬁt of biodegradation procedures is cost efﬁciency,
with minimum investments in resources and energy. Anyway, compared to physical–
chemical approaches, the most important disadvantage of removing organic compounds
based on microorganisms’ activity is that it is a time-consuming process. The biodegradation process of PFAS can take from a few days to a few weeks for equilibrium to be
established (Table 1), compared to physical–chemical treatments, which can take a much
shorter period of time. Therefore, a signiﬁcant direction of study was to ﬁnd new effective bacterial strains that can quickly remove PFAS from various environmental matrices.
While different suppositions for biodegradation are confused, preliminary data suggest the
probability of fast biodegradation for PFAS compounds, encouraging future investigations
for the development of PFAS biodegradation technology using bacterial strains.
The purpose of the study was to investigate the ability and efﬁciency of two Pseudomonas bacterial strains, namely Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida, to degrade PFOA and PFOS. The use of such microorganisms can contribute to the improvement
of the wastewater treatment process in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) through
bioaugmentation or other bioremediation processes. Bacteria are economical alternatives
compared to other processes, such as the catalytical ones, which can constitute an additional
step in WWTPs. The study followed three principal objectives: (a) to evaluate the biodegradation degree of PFOA and PFOS by P. aeruginosa and P. putida during 96 h of incubation;
(b) to evaluate the pollution stress caused by PFOA and PFOS to the Pseudomonas bacteria
strains; (c) to establish a possible (bio)degradation pathway for PFOA and PFOS.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Chemicals and Reagents
Analytical standards (purity > 99%): perﬂuorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perﬂuoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), perﬂuorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perﬂuoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA),
perﬂuorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perﬂuorosulfonic acid (PFOS), perﬂuorononanoic acid

HPLC grade) and Methanol (MeOH, HPLC grade) were provided by Merck (Darmstadt,
Germany) and ammonium acetate (≥98%) from Sigma-Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany).
Ultrapure water was obtained in-house using a Milli-Q water system purchased from
Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).
Speciﬁc solid culture medium, namely trypticase soy agar, was obtained from VWR
Chemicals (Leuven, Belgium). The liquid culture medium, namely acetamide broth, was
acquired from Scharlau (Spain). Pseudomonas aeruginosa WDCM 00026 VT 000263 bacterial

strain was purchased from (Saint Louis, Missouri, US), while Pseudomonas putida (ATCC
17514) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA.
2.2. Pseudomonas Strain Culture Growth
Evaluation of the biodegradation capacity of PFOA and PFOS by referenced bacterial
strains was carried out using two bacterial strains from the genus Pseudomonas, namely
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (B1) and Pseudomonas putida (B2). Initially, the inoculation of the
bacterial strains was performed on solid nutrient medium for 24 h (35 ◦C incubation temperature) (Binder GmbH, Germany). After this period, a single colony from each of P.
aeruginosa and P. putida was relocated to a particular liquid culture medium, liquid broth
with acetamide (AN). Acetamide broth is a liquid culture medium recommended for the
differentiation of non-fermentative Gram-negative bacteria, especially for the bacteria identiﬁcation and conﬁrmation of the genus Pseudomonas. The incubation period in the liquid
medium was carried out for 24 h at 37 ◦C and 130 rpm (Incubator Innova 44acquired from
New Brunswick Scientiﬁc,). Bacterial growth was measured using the UV-VIS spectrophotometer (VWR International, Radnor, PA, USA) at 600 nm absorbance. Bacterial strains
with optical density (OD) equal to 0.2 were used in the biodegradation experiments of
PFOA and PFOS.
2.3. Bacterial Growth Inhibition Evaluation
Bacterial strains with OD600nm equal to 0.2 were incubated for 96 h in presence of
PFOS and PFOA at three different concentrations: 10 mg/L, 1 mg/L, 0.1 mg/L. All the
experimental determination of the absorbance value, which is closely correlated with
the bacterial growth, was established according to a negative control represented by the
unseeded bacterial growth medium.
Bacterial growth rate in presence of the three PFOS and PFOA concentration levels
was quantiﬁed at OD600nm by comparison with a positive control consisting of each bacterial strain (BM) in the speciﬁc growth medium (acetamide broth), without the chemical
compounds. Furthermore, aliquots of 1 mL were extracted from the incubation at 0 h,
2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h after contamination and were kept at −20 ◦C until
the LC-MS analysis. Acetamide broth with each individual compound (PFOA/PFOS-M)
represented the control sample for the analytical experiments.
2.4. Chemical Analysis
The experimental analysis was performed through liquid chromatography–tandem
mass spectrometry technique (LC/MS-MS) using an Agilent 1260 and an Agilent 6410B (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The parent compounds and biotransformation
products’ chromatographic separation was achieved on a Zorbax Eclipse C18 chromatographic column (2.1 × 100 mm, 3.5 µm). The column temperature was set at 30 ◦C. Samples
of 10 µL were injected using an autosampler. The compounds were eluted using a mobile
phase consisting of aqueous 5mM ammonium acetate (A) and MeOH (B). The ﬂow rate
was 0.2 mL/min. The gradient elution program is shown in Table S1, having a stop time
of 25 min. To increase the sensitivity of the determination, the acquisition of the triple
quadrupole detector was set in MRM mode with 6 time segments (Table S2 and Figure S1).
The optimized MS and ESI operational parameters are showed in Tables S3 and S4. The
biodegradation efﬁciency was evaluated using the Equation (1)
Biodegradation (%) = (C0 −C)/C0 × 100
(1)
where C—concentration of the organic compound (mg/L) at time t, C0—initial concentration of the organic compound (mg/L).
2.5. Sample Preparation for Analytical Detection
The test and control samples were thawed at room temperature and vortexed for
1 min. The sample preparation method focused on the precipitation of proteins and other

interfering compounds existing in the growth medium, with an organic solvent such as
acetonitrile to minimize the matrix effect that can affect the mass spectrometric detection.
To a 200 µL sample (medium—M, P. aeruginosa or P. Putida in medium—B1/B2-M, PFOA
or PFOS in medium—PFOA/PFOS-M and P. aeruginosa or P. Putida incubated with PFOA
or PFOS at different concentration—B1/B2-PFOA/PFOS-C), 400 µL ACN was added,
vortexed (1 min) and centrifuged (at 14,000 RPM for 5 min). After the precipitate was
decantated, 400 µL of the supernatant was moved to a 2 mL vial.
2.6. QA and QC Section
The experiments were performed in triplicate. For each sample sequence, two blank
samples, containing ultra-pure water and methanol, and 2 standard solutions (1 and
75 µg/L) were analyzed. The calibration curves were ﬁt in the range of 0.1 and 100 µg/L
(R2 > 0.9996), and all samples were diluted to their suitable concentration. The method’s
sensibility was tested based on the analysis of blank samples (ultrapure water and MeOH).
The detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) limits were determined to be 0.3 and 1 µg/L,
respectively, with signal-to-noise ratio of 10:1. Standard deviations were situated between
3 and 5%.
2.7. Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Ofﬁce Excel 2021.
3. Results
3.1. Decrease of PFOA and PFOS in the Presence of Pseudomonas Strains
During the tested period (96 h), for the control experiments regarding the abiotic
degradation of PFOA and PFOS, a decrease in concentrations of the two analytes in the
growth medium was observed. The values of abiotic degradation ranged between 1.12 and
1.42% for PFOA and between 0.16 and 0.22% for PFOS.
Under the P. aeruginosa activity, a decrease in PFOA levels was observed over time (up
to 96 h). The biodegradation degree rose as the tested concentration lowered (Figure 1a).
Thus, at the end of the experiments, after 96 h, the degradation percentage of PFOA was
3.17% in the experiments in which 10 mg/L PFOA was used, 12.0% for the concentration
of 1 mg/L and 27.9% for 0.1 mg/L PFOA. The reported percentages were corrected with
those obtained in the control experiment. The increase in the percentage of biodegradation
with the decrease in the concentration of the organic compound, in the presence of the
P. aeruginosa, was also observed for the experiments regarding the PFOS biodegradation
(Figure 1b). The values of the biodegradation percentages were obtained after subtracting
the values obtained in the control experiment. Thus, in descending order of the tested
concentrations, the biodegradation percentages were 11.5% for 10 mg/L PFOS, 33.3% for
1 mg/L PFOS and 47.4% for 0.1 mg/L PFOS, respectively.

The same pattern could be observed for the experiments performed in the presence
of P. putida. The percentage of biodegradation increased with the decrease of the test

concentration (Figure 2). Thus, the biodegradation percentages, calculated after the values
obtained for control experiment were subtracted, were 1.84% for the test concentration of
10 mg/L, 12.3% for 1 mg/L and 19.0% for 0.1 mg/L PFOA (Figure 2a), respectively. For
the three PFOS concentrations tested, the biodegradation percentages obtained after 96 h
from the start of the experiments were 6.35% for 10 mg/L, 26.6% for 1 mg/L and 46.9% for
0.1 mg/L (Figure 2b).

(b) 
Figure 2. Biodegradation (percentage) of PFOA (a) and PFOS (b) during the incubation with P. Putida.
Comparing the results obtained in the presence of the two bacterial strains, it can be
stated that P. aeruginosa shows a higher efﬁciency in terms of the PFOA biodegradation
process, while, for PFOS, both bacterial strains affect biodegradation in a similar way for
the concentration tested.
3.2. Bacterial Growth Inhibition in Presence of PFOA and PFOS
The growth inhibition degree of P. aeruginosa in the presence of PFOA increased with
the increase in the tested substance concentration. The lowest percentage of inhibition
of the growth of P. aeruginosa was observed in the case of the concentration of 0.1 mg/L
PFOA, varying from 16% in the ﬁrst 2 h of contact to 23% after 6 h, dropping to 5% after
24 h. Thus, an adaptation of the bacteria in the presence of PFOA after 24 h was noted
both in the presence of the concentration of 0.1 mg/L and in the case of 1 mg/L, a fact
corroborated with the increase in the percentage of degradation of the substance together
with the decrease in the degree of inhibition of bacterial growth (Table S5 and Figure 3a).
The experiments regarding the evaluation of the P. aeruginosa growth inhibition in the
presence of PFOS presented the same characteristics compared to the inhibition test of the
same bacteria incubated with PFOA, except that an inhibition of approximatively 3 times
higher was observed for the lower concentrations in the ﬁrst 2 h of contact and up to 24 h.
An adaptation of P. aeruginosa in the presence of PFOS was noted after 24 h, when growth
inhibition was considerably reduced (Table S7 and Figure 3b). This fact correlates with the
increase in the biodegradation percentage of PFOS (Figure 1b) along with the decrease in
the P. aeruginosa inhibition degree after 24 h and up to 96 h.
Regarding the growth inhibition degree of P. putida, a greater variation was observed
compared to P. aeruginosa throughout the test in the presence of the same concentration
levels of PFOA. The inhibition degree was 100% at the highest concentration tested, 10 mg/L
PFOA, while, at lower values, the percentage of growth inhibition ﬂuctuated up to 72 h
(Tables S6 and S7). The growth inhibition degree of P. putida in the presence of PFOS was
higher than in the presence of PFOA for all tested concentrations. Unlike P. aeruginosa, for P.
putida, a greater variation was observed during the 96 h of the growth inhibition test in the
presence of PFOS. The P. putida growth inhibition was proportionally lower for the lowest
concentration (0.1 mg/L PFOS), indicating that approximately 80% of the viable bacterial
population, after 48 h of contact, would have led to a compound degradation of 46.9%,
compared to the PFOS concentration of 1 mg/L, at which the percentage of biodegradation
was approximately 2 times lower. The biodegradation percentage of 26.6% in the case of

## Page 7

Sustainability 2023, 15, 14000
7 of 12
1 mg/L PFOS can also be deduced from the fact that more than half, 56%, of the P. putida
bacterial population was inhibited after 48 h of contact (Table S8 and Figure 4b).

3.3. Biotransformation Products Sustain the PFOA and PFOS Biodegradation by
Pseudomonas Strains
Since PFOA and PFOS quantiﬁcation might be inﬂuenced by sample preparation and
manipulation, identiﬁcation and quantitation of biodegradation products with shorter
aliphatic chains in the ﬁnal samples of every experiment was used as supplementary key
conﬁrmation of PFOA and PFOS biodegradation. During the experiments that involved
studies on the biodegradation of PFOA in the presence of the bacterial strain P. aeruginosa,
the formation of a single biodegradation product was observed, namely PFHxA (Table 2).
In the test where 0.1 mg/L PFOA was used, the formation of PFHxA was observed 4 h
after the start of the experiment and increased from 0.12 µg/L to 0.57 µg/L. For the test
in which 1 mg/L PFOA was used, the formation of PFHxA was also observed after 4 h,
but the concentration increased from 0.56 µg/L to 0.60 µg/L at 24 h, after which it started
to decrease, reaching 0.36 µg/L at the end of the experiment (96 h). This decrease can be
based on the biodegradation of this compound under the inﬂuence of the bacterial strain.
In the presence of P. putida, PFOA biodegradation led to the formation of three
biodegradation products: PFHxA, PFHpA and PFPeA, the latter being determined only
in the case of the experiment in which the PFOA concentration was 0.1 mg/L (Table 2).
The formation of biodegradation products followed a similar pattern, their presence being
observed after 4 h from the start of the experiments. Their concentration increased over
time until 48 h, after which they began to decrease, being biodegraded, in turn, by P. putida.
Despite the fact that its formation was observed only in one test, PFPeA was detected with
the higher values, the concentration domain being situated at 0.39 and 28 µg/L.

Following the results obtained, it can be stated that the biodegradation mechanism of
PFOA by Pseudomonas strains consisted in obtaining biodegradation products with shorter
aliphatic chains by removing a -CF2 group. The proposed biodegradation pathway is
presented in Scheme 1.
Scheme 1. Biodegradation pathway proposed for PFOA during the incubation with Pseudomonas
strains.
During the biodegradation experiments involving the incubation of P. aeruginosa with
PFOS, at low concentrations (0.1 mg/L and 1 mg/L), two biodegradation products were
identiﬁed (Table 3). The formation of the perﬂuoro alkylated derivative with six carbon
atoms in the aliphatic chain, PFHxA, was observed early, after 2 h of the tests beginning.
In the ﬁrst experiment (0.1 mg/L PFOS), its concentration increased until 48 h, reaching
a maximum of 0.45 µg/L, after which it decreased, reaching 0.38 µg/L. In the case of the
higher concentration of PFOS, 1 mg/L, the values determined for PFHxA increased up to
0.64 µg/L at 24 h, after which they decreased, reaching a value of 0.16 µg/L at the end
of the experiment (after 96 h). A similar behavior was observed for the counterpart with
seven carbon atoms in the aliphatic chain, for both concentrations of PFOS (0.1 mg/L and
1 mg/L). Its formation was identiﬁed starting at 2 h and recorded an increase for 24 h,
reaching values up to 0.26 µg/L. After this period, the concentrations begin to decrease
over time.
The experiments carried out in the presence of P. putida also highlighted the formation
of the 2 biodegradation products (PFHxA and PFHpA), when the concentrations of PFOS
involved were 0.1 and 1 mg/L, respectively (Table 3). In the case of these experiments, the
formation of these products was observed starting 6 h from the beginning of the incubation
experiments. The maximum values were determined in the samples taken 72 h after the
experiments started, and then the values decreased in the following 24 h. The decrease in
concentrations of biodegradation products after a certain period of time can be due, also,
to their degradation by Pseudomonas strains. For experiments that involved the highest
concentration of PFOA and PFOS (10 mg/L), the formation of biodegradation products
was not observed.

Although a relatively high percentage of biodegradation of PFOS was recorded, the
concentrations tested were low, and, implicitly, the amount biodegraded was small, which
made it impossible to identify the unknown intermediates through an analytical screening
method. Thus, the proposed mechanism regarding the biodegradation of PFOS by the
bacterial strains P. aeruginosa and P. Putida is presented in Scheme 2.

strains.
4. Discussion
The results obtained in the present study are very promising and can be compared with
those reported in the specialized literature (Table 1). Studies carried out using the bacterium
Acidimicrobium sp. Strain A6 to remove PFOA and PFOS in the aerobic environment
reported values of the removal degree up to 63% for 0.1 mg/L PFOA and up to 50% for
a test concentration of 100 mg/L PFOA in 100 days, while, for PFOS, the removal degree
was 60% and 47% for test concentrations of 0.1 mg/L and 100 mg/L PFOS, respectively, in
100 days [30]. Also, PFOA could be removed up to 48% in an aerobic environment in 5 days
by the bacteria P. parafulva Strain YAB1 [10], while the initial concentration of 1.8 mg/L and
500 mg/L were removed up to 67% in 2 days by P. aeruginosa strain HJ4 [9] and up to 75%
in 90 days by the bacterium P. plecoglossicida [29], respectively.
The present work showed no abiotic PFOA and PFOS degradation during 96 h and,
subsequently, no degradation by-products. In the presence of bacterial strains, there
was observed a decrease in PFOA and PFOS concentrations, which was correlated to a
raise of biodegradation by-products such as PFPeA, PFHxA and PFHpA. Singh and his
collaborators proposed a PFOA and PFOS deﬂuorination, causing a transformation into
PFHxA and PFHpA [32]. This transformation ﬁtted our experimental model only when
bacterial strains were added, which meant that bacteria could trigger deﬂuorination and
C-C bond oxidation [8]. The exact bacterial enzymatic equipment involved in PFOA and
PFOS biodegradation, and, subsequently, deﬂuorination, is not yet characterized and will
serve as the main theme of a further study.
Despite the fact that not many research papers focused their studies on the identiﬁcation of biodegradation products, PFPeA, PFHxA and PFHpA were commonly biotrans-

formation products of PFOA reported in the literature, while, for PFOS, compounds such
as PFBA, PFBS, PFHxS and PFHpA were communicated as the major biotransformation
products [8,9,29].
The results of this research open new possibilities for the use of P. aeruginosa and P.
putida in the bioremediation of PFOA and PFOS. Improving the bioremediation processes
by bioaugmentation could represent a simple, efﬁcient, fast, environmentally safe and
cost-effective technology to treat PFAS-contaminated water.
5. Conclusions
The results obtained in this study demonstrate that pure Pseudomonas strains, namely P.
aeruginosa and P putida, could successfully biodegrade two of the most used perﬂuoroalkyl
substances, PFOA and PFOS. Under speciﬁc conditions, the PFOA concentration was
biologically transformed up to 27.9% and 19%, respectively, after 96 h of incubation time
with P. aeruginosa and P. putida, respectively. In the case of PFOS, the two bacteria were
more effective compared to PFOA. The biodegradation percentages obtained were up to
47.3% in the presence of P. aeruginosa and up to 46.9% in the presence of P. putida.
During the biodegradation tests, biotransformation products of the two parent compounds could be identiﬁed. During the PFOA biodegradation by P. aeruginosa, only one
biodegradation product was identiﬁed (PFHxA), while the biodegradation by P. putida led
to the identiﬁcation of three biodegradation products (PFPeA, PFPxA and PFHpA). The
biodegradation of PFOS by both bacteria strains generated the same two biodegradation
products in both cases (PFPxA and PFHpA). Although it was observed that PFOA and
PFOS had a signiﬁcant impact on the bacterial community, especially at high concentrations,
the adaptation of Pseudomonas chains was observed in all experiments, throughout the 96 h
incubation period. The promising results support the use of Pseudomonas strains and their
metabolic pathways, validating the conceptualization of using Pseudomonas-based bacterial
models for PFOA and PFOS removal.
