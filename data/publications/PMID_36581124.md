Abstract
The global elimination and restriction of perfluorooctanoic acid
(PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), respectively,
have urged manufacturers to shift production to their substitutes
which still pose threat to the environment with their
bioaccumulation, toxicity and migration issues. In this context,
efficient technologies and systematic mechanistic studies on the
degradation of PFOA/PFOS substitutes are highly desirable. In this
review, we summarize the progress in degrading PFOA/PFOS

## Page 8

substitutes, including four kinds of mainstream methods. The pros
and cons of the present technologies are analyzed, which renders
the discussion of future prospects on rational optimizations.
Additional discussion is made on the differences in the degradation
of various kinds of substitutes, which is compared to the PFOA/
PFOS and derives designing principles for more degradable Fcontaining compounds.
Keywords: Bio-degradation; Electro-degradation; PFOA/PFOS
substitutes; Photo-degradation; Sono-degradation.
