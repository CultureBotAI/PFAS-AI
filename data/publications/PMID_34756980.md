Abstract
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of chemicals
widely manufactured for industrial and commercial applications in

## Page 8

the past decades due to their remarkable stability as well as
hydrophobic and lipophobic nature. PFAS species have been
recognized as emerging environmental contaminants of concern due
to their toxicity and environmental persistence, thereby attracting
intensive research seeking effective technologies for their removal
from the environment. The objective of this review is to provide a
thorough analysis of the biodegradation of PFAS in multiple
environmental matrices and offer a future outlook. By discussing
targeted PFAS species, degradation intermediates, degradation
efficiencies, and microbial species, a comprehensive summary of the
known microbial species and their degradation pathways are
presented. The biodegradation pathways for different types of PFAS
species are summarized in two major categories, biodegradation
with and without the cleavage of C-F bond. Existing uncertainties
and future research directions for PFAS biodegradation are
provided.
Keywords: Biodegradation; C-F bond cleavage; Fate and pathways;
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).
