ABSTRACT
Large-scale manufacturing and disposal of fluorinated chemicals have led to global pollution by perand polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that will require novel remediation techniques and investigation 
for their environmental fates. Fungi are dominant carbon nutrient recyclers in ecosystems, but their 
roles in responding to and degrading these persistent fluorocarbons remain largely untapped. Here, we 
investigated the fungal species’ responses to perflouroalkyl carboxylic acid (PFCA) chemicals and their 
capacities in breaking down C–F bonds for defluorination (deF) by using the ion-selective electrode for 
quantifying free fluoride anions and the 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) for monitoring PFAS 
removal in fungal cultures. Cytotoxicity assays showed that taxa within a unique class of fungi that 
cause “white rot” type of wood decay have developed an inherent defense mechanism for fluoride and 
fluorocarbon chemicals, setting off a basis for further investigating their deF phenotype. Although the 
current test did not evidence clear deF in legacy PFAS, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and 
perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), it identified dehalogenated PFCA structures associated with an 
electron-attracting alkenyl group that provokes C–F cleavage. Our research, therefore, set a foundation 
for further unraveling the fungal deF mechanisms, and it also highlighted that future research should 
give sufficient attention to resident fungal communities in impacted environments due to their 
potential to recycle fluorinated compounds.

INTRODUCTION
Fluorinated carbon chemicals, particularly per- and poly­
fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are widely used for 
consumable products and firefighting foams, are 
a growing source of pollution of concern to the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (Abunada 
et al. 2020). Traditional waste management facilities, 
including landfills and wastewater treatment plants, are 
facing difficulties treating these chemicals (Coggan et al.  
2019; Lang et al. 2017; Liou et al. 2010), and their runoffs 
are leading to significant accumulations of PFAS in soil, 
water, and other environments (Anderson et al. 2016; 
Brusseau et al. 2020; Lang et al. 2017; Masoner et al.  
2020). Structures of PFAS are considered exceptionally 
persistent and non-biodegradable in natural environ­
ments, mainly due to their C–F bonds, which have the 
strongest bond dissociation energy (130 kcal mol−1) 
among the single carbon bonds (Bentel et al. 2019; Buck 
et al. 2011; Wang and Liu 2020). Being able to cleave the 
inert C–F bond, namely, defluorination (deF), is there­
fore recognized as the crucial step toward the biodegra­
dation of PFAS (Kucharzyk et al. 2017). However, the deF 
capacity of microorganisms remains a rarely discovered 
phenotype (Wackett 2022). Recent studies have suggested 
that microbes have developed limited capacities to bio­
transform or defluorinate (deF) PFAS (Che et al. 2021; 
Colosi et al. 2009; Huang et al. 2022; Luo et al. 2018; 
Merino et al. 2018; Tseng et al. 2014), but the relevant 
studies are overall still limited in fungal species. Our 
research, therefore, aims to explore the deF capacities in 
a ubiquitous group of fungi that can cause wood decay 
and are crucial to carbon nutrient recycling in ecosys­
tems, thus advancing our understanding of fungal roles 
in recycling fluorinated carbon compounds.
Wood decay fungi are primary plant carbon degra­
ders in forest systems, and they evolved unique machin­
ery to degrade lignin to expose polysaccharides 
embedded in plant cell walls (Andlar et al. 2018). 
These fungi adopted a set of oxidoreductases and hydro­
lases to break down the inert linkages of lignin, which 
meanwhile provides fungal cells the capacity to cometabolize xenobiotic chemicals such as plastics, 
organic dyes, and halogenated pharmaceuticals (Zhuo 
and Fan 2021). Although it remains a debate whether or 
not the fungi can leverage their ligninolytic systems to 
degrade PFAS, studies have demonstrated that fungal 
species have the potential to degrade short fluorinated 
carbon chain chemicals. For example, a Fusarium solani

strain isolated from “rodenticide 1080” contaminated 
soil can deF the C–F bond of fluoroacetate (Walker 
and Lien 1981), with fluoroacetate dehalogenase 
(FAcD) being characterized as the deF catalyst. The 
most recent catalytic model further suggested that 
FAcD not only can deF monofluoroacetate via 
a hydrolytic mechanism, but it also can catalyze the 
deF of poly- or perfluoroacetate to glyoxylate (Yue 
et al. 2021). However, whether a similar deF process 
has been adopted in other fungal species, especially in 
wood decay fungi, to deF the sturdier PFAS with longer 
carbon chains still requires further investigation.
Studies on fungal degradation of PFAS are still in 
their infancy, and research mostly focuses on investigat­
ing the aerobic degradation processes, as fungal meta­
bolism primarily relies on respiration for gaining 
energy. Tseng et al. (2014) investigated the degradation 
of 6:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (6:2 FTOH) [F 
(CF2)6CH2CH2OH] by a “white rot” wood decay fun­
gus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Their results sug­
gested that this fungus has the biochemical pathways 
to aerobically transform 6:2 FTOH into a mixture of 
shorter-chain poly- and per- and polyfluoroalkyl car­
boxylic acid (PFCAs) [e.g., perfluoropentanoic (PFPeA) 
and perfluorohexanoic (PFHxA) acids] and other poly­
fluoroalkyl analogs/conjugates, with the majority pro­
duct being 5:3 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (5:3 FTCA) 
[F(CF2)5CH2CH2COOH]. Within this research, by 
referring to that of aerobic bacterial processes, the 
authors proposed that 6:2 FTOH can be firstly con­
verted to 6:2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acid 
(6:2 FTUCA) [F(CF2)5CF=CHCOOH] via a series of 
oxidative steps, followed by β-elimination to remove 
fluorine to produce 5:3 FTUCA and then to 5:3 FTCA. 
Alternativelly, 6:2 FTUCA can also be subjected to dec­
arboxylation and α-elimination for deF, leading to the 
production of PFPeA or PFHxA. Merino et al. (2018) 
from the same research group then expanded this 
research and rediscovered the biotransformation of 6:2 
FTOH with more wood-rotting fungal species, which 
repeatedly demonstrated that fungal degradation yields 
5:3 FTCA (up to 51 mol% of initial 6:2 FTOH dosed) as 
the dominant transformation product. This research 
also claimed that 5:3 FTCA might be further trans­
formed via the “one-carbon removal” cycle (Wang 
et al. 2012), despite that the process will likely be termi­
nated at the step of 4:3 FTCA in fungi. Together, these 
works suggested that wood decay fungi are capable of 
transforming fluorotelomer alcohols to PFCAs.
Although wood decay fungi have shown their poten­
tial to transform fluorotelomer alcohols, free fluoride 
products were not detected in the previous research 
(Merino et al. 2018; Tseng et al. 2014), leaving 
a significant question of whether they can deF PFAS. 
Notably, the capability of these organisms to deF PFAS 
in the carboxylic acid format—PFCAs [e.g., perfluor­
ooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic 
acid (PFOS)] underscored by EPA regulations— 
requires further study, as this still remains a rare phe­
notype. Zhou et al. (2023) proposed that PFOA can be 
transformed via the combined cross-coupling and rear­
rangement processes catalyzed by free radicals during its 
degradation by Phanerochaete chrysosporium, the same 
white rot fungal species used by Tseng et al. (2014). 
Although this proposed model suggested a concurrent 
deF process, the detection of free F− was not reported in 
the research (Zhou et al. 2023). Using a soil mucor 
fungus Cunninghamella elegans, Khan et al. (2023) 
found 20–30% deF of PFOA after 48 h of fungal treat­
ment but detected a different set of transformation 
products than in P. chrysosporium. Alternative bio­
chemical pathways of PFOA degradation were therefore 
proposed for C. elegans, suggesting that fungi may have 
developed various mechanisms to degrade PFAS, and 
broader investigation in alternative fungal species would 
be required. As a consequence, the missing information 
on deF in wood decay fungi has concurrently led to 
a major challenge in studying the corresponding bio­
chemical pathways adopted for fungal degradation of 
PFAS. For instance, it complicated associating biocata­
lysts [e.g., cytochrome P450 (Merino et al. 2023), laccase 
(Luo et al. 2018), and ligninolytic peroxidase (Colosi 
et al. 2009)] with their functions in PFAS degradation. 
In this regard, more investigations into wood decay 
fungi for their capacities to deF PFCA chemicals are 
required.
In this study, we first monitored the radial growth of 
a collective of wood decay fungi on PFCAs to evaluate 
their responses to the toxicities of parent PFAS and of the 
possible defluorination products. By doing this, we 
expected to delineate the fungal response to PFAS toxi­
city across a broader taxonomic scale. Meanwhile, as the 
cytotoxicity of PFAS could be mediated by fluorosis, 
which impairs the functions of essential enzymes by 
competing with metal ions, such as Mg2+, for binding 
sites (Strunecka and Strunecky 2020; Waugh 2019), fun­
gal tolerance was used as an indirect indicator for screen­
ing deF potentials. Thus, although PFAS tolerance of 
a fungal strain does not necessarily prove its deF capacity, 
it will facilitate the rapid screening of the candidate 
species for further studying the fungal degradation pro­
cesses of PFAS. Following this, we then adapted 
a potentiometer method using a fluoride ion selective 
electrode (F-ISE) to investigate their deF capacities. 
With appropriate optimizations in a previous work, we 
have confirmed that the F-ISE method demonstrated

reliability in quantifying free fluoride anions within the 
unique nutrient and metabolite backgrounds of fungal 
cultures (Ayers and Zhang 2025). Our results indicated 
that the fungal response to PFCAs is dependent on both 
the fungal clade and the type of wood decay. Notably, 
fungi that cause “white rot,” particularly from the 
Agaricales and Polyporales groups, exhibited a distinct 
tolerance to the legacy PFCA chemical PFOA. This 
potential for PFAS detoxification was confirmed using 
the typical white rot species Trametes versicolor, along 
with eight PFCA chemicals and sodium fluoride (NaF). 
The screening of fungal deF capacities using F-ISE aligns 
with previous work demonstrating that fluorine attached 
to the unsaturated carbon atoms or those adjacent to 
unsaturated bonds [e.g., 4,4,4-trifluoro-3-(trifluoro­
methyl)crotonic acid ((CF3)2C=CHCOOH), 4,5,5-tri­
fluoropent-4-enoic acid (F2C=CFCH2CH2COOH), and 
2-(trifluoromethyl)acrylic acid (H2C=C(CF3)COOH)] 
are susceptible to bacterial attack (Che et al. 2021; Yu 
et al. 2022). In contrast, fungal deF was not detected for 
the legacy PFCAs and fluorotelomer alcohols, such as 
PFOA, PFOS, GenX, and 6:2 FTOH, that lack unsatu­
rated bonds. Overall, this research demonstrates 
a distinct biological response of a group of ubiquitous 
wood decomposer fungi to PFCA chemicals and provides 
fungal and chemical models for studying deF mechan­
isms in relation to various PFCA compounds.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
PFAS and fluoride chemicals.—Eight PFAS and 
sodium fluoride (NaF) were purchased from Sigma 
Aldrich (Milwaukee, Wisconsin) [PFOA, CAS no. 33567-1, 98% purity; PFOS, 1763-23-1, 98% purity; 6:2 
FTOH, 647-42-7, 97% purity; 2-(trifluoromethyl)acrylic 
acid, 381-98-6, 98% purity; vinyl trifluoroacetate, 43328-3, 98% purity; NaF, 7681-49-4, 99.99% purity], 
Matrix Scientific (Columbia, South Carolina) [GenX, 
13252-13-6, 97% purity; 4,4-trifluoro-3-(trifluoro­
methyl)crotonic acid, 1763-28-6, 97% purity], and 
Oakwood Chemical (Estill, South Carolina) [4,5,5-tri­
fluoropent-4-enoic acid, 110003-22-0, 97% purity], and 
10 mM stock solutions, except PFOS, which was pre­
pared at 1 mM, were prepared aseptically in sterilized 
deionized water and stored at room temperature under 
constant agitation at 150 rpm until use. Polypropylene 
bottles containing the stock solutions were sonicated in 
Bransonic M Mechanical Bath 3800 (40 kHz) for 20 min 
to disperse micellar structures and homogenize PFAS 
solution prior to the spiking of fungal cultures. We have 
confirmed that under this low-intensity sonication, the 
PFAS chemicals tested here will not be defluorinated, 
although it has been reported by others that more 
intensive sonication (≥500 kHz for hours) may lead to 
the PFAS degradation (Awoyemi et al. 2024; Singh Kalra 
et al. 2021).
Fungal strains and culture conditions.—Wood 
decomposer fungal strains Trametes versicolor A1ATF, Stereum hirsutum FP-91666, Fomitopsis pinicola 
FP105877R, and other mentioned species were obtained 
from the United States Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) Forest Products Laboratory (FPL; Madison, 
Wisconsin) or the Forest Mycology Collection at the 
University of Minnesota. The strains were stored on 
YMG (yeast extract 4 g/L, malt extract 10 g/L, glucose 
10 g/L) agar slants at 4 C until being used for degrading 
PFCAs. Fungal mycelia were activated on YMG agar 
plates at 28 C for 6 days before being tested for their 
resistance to PFCA and fluoride chemicals and their deF 
capacities with either liquid or solid-state culturing con­
ditions. The 15 g/L agar was used to make the agar slant 
or plate.
Plate culture was performed to test the resistance of 
18 fungal species to a variety of PFCA compounds and 
fluoride anions at different concentrations in Highley’s 
minimum medium (HMM) (Highley 1973) that con­
tains 10 g/L glucose and the following basal salts addi­
tions (per liter): essential nutrient mix I: 2 g NH4NO3, 
2 g KH2PO4, 0.5 g MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1 g CaC12·2H2O; 
trace metal mix II: 0.57 mg H3BO4, 0.036 mg 
MnC12·4H2O, 0.31 mg ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.039 mg 
CuSO4·5H2O, 
0.018 
mg 
(NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 
0.015 mg FeSO4·7H2O; and 0.001 g thiamine hydro­
chloride. Mycelial growth on the plate was measured 
by monitoring the changes in the colony diameters over 
time.
Liquid cultures were conducted in five replicates in 
125-mL Erlenmeyer polypropylene plastic flasks con­
taining 50 mL of HMM spiked to 100 µM of the corre­
sponding PFCA compounds to test fungal deF. HMM 
was supplemented with 1 g/L glucose and 10 g/L aspen 
wood sawdust as carbon sources. Ten 5-mm activated 
mycelial plugs were used to inoculate each flask, and the 
cultures were incubated at 28 C and 110 rpm for up to 
3 weeks. Two milliliters of sample per flask were ali­
quoted every week and were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm 
and 4 C for collecting the supernatant for F− quantifica­
tion. The inoculated flasks without spiking PFCA, as 
well as flasks with PFCA but without fungal inoculum, 
were also prepared as the controls.
Solid-state fermentation (SSF) [moisture contents 
(MC) = 80–83%] in polypropylene Petri dishes in five 
replicates was used to test the deF of PFCAs by 
T. versicolor, whereas semisolid, slurry culture (MC =

91%) was in 125-mL Erlenmeyer polypropylene plastic 
flasks. To prepare the medium, each 100 mL HMM basal 
salts solution (~100 g) containing 100 µM PFCA com­
pound of interest was added 25, 20, or 10 g aspen wood 
sawdust (Populus sp.; particle size 250–425 µm, i.e., from 
40 to 60 mesh) to bring the MC [(HMM solution weight/ 
total medium weight) × 100%] to 80%, 83%, or 91%, 
respectively. To facilitate the growth of wood decay 
fungi, the medium was also supplemented with 1% (w/ 
w) maize meal. After thorough mixing, 20 g of medium 
was distributed into each dish/flask and was inoculated 
with five 5-mm activated T. versicolor mycelial plugs. SSF 
cultures were then incubated in a stationary-humidity 
chamber at 28 C and 70% humidity for up to 3 weeks, 
whereas slurry cultures were incubated in a shaking incu­
bator at 110 rpm. After harvest, the entire SSF culture was 
oven-dried at 70 C and then transferred to a 50-mL 
Falcon tube containing 30 mL of distilled deionized 
(DDI) water for F− extraction overnight with 
a horizontal agitator at 150 rpm and 4 C. Supernatants, 
collected by centrifuging the mixtures at 4000 rpm and 4 
C for 10 min, were then used for measuring F−. The 
inoculated plates without spiking PFCA were used as 
the controls, and five bioreplicates were used for each 
condition. The end-point MC of the SSF culture was 
measured by subtracting oven-dried weight from total 
wet weight to back calculate the F− concentrations in 
the cultures. The F− concentrations in slurry cultures 
were obtained by directly measuring the supernatants of 
the centrifuged cultures.
Fluoride 
Ion 
Selective 
Electrode 
(F-ISE) 
measurement in fungal cultures.—The potentio­
metric method for measuring fluoride ion was opti­
mized using the Orion Star A214 pH/ISE benchtop 
meter 
(Thermo 
Fisher 
Scientific, 
Waltham, 
Massachusetts) and the Orion Fluoride Ionplus SureFlow 
solid-state 
combination 
electrode 
(CAS 
no. 9609BNWP) (Ayers and Zhang 2025). Two total 
ionic strength adjuster buffers (TISABs) were tested 
for their effects in eliminating the interference of fungal 
medium components. The low-level TISAB was pre­
pared by dissolving 57 mL glacial acetic acid and 58 g 
of NaCl in DDI water, adjusting the pH with 5 M NaOH 
to 5.0–5.5, and finally fixing the total volume to 1 L with 
DDI 
water. 
TISAB 
II, 
with 
xxx 
1,2Cyclohexylenedinitrilotetraacetic acid (CDTA) and 
a stronger buffering capacity (CAS no. 940909), was 
purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Results 
showed that the stronger TISAB II buffer can efficiently 
mitigate fungal culture interferences. Thus, it was used 
for the F-ISE measurement of fungal samples.
To measure F−, TISAB II was mixed 1:1 with the F− 
solution and incubated for 15 min at room temperature 
(20–22 C) before analysis. F-ISE measurement was done 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After cali­
bration in storage solution for 5 min, the probe was 
immersed in F− solution for recording the millivolt 
(mV) reading in 5 min or until the reading was stable. 
The probe was rinsed and allowed to rest in a storage 
solution between different measurements. In this pro­
cedure, all solutions must be kept at the same tempera­
ture and pH (5–5.5), given that the changes in these two 
factors affect the electrode potentials. The mV readings 
were plotted against the F− concentrations to test the 
effectiveness of the optimized F-ISE method.
The fungal extracts collected from liquid and solid 
fermentations, as above, were measured for fluoride 
concentrations using F-ISE. To do this, the TISAB II 
buffer with CDTA was mixed 1:1 with the extract in 
a 15-mL Falcon tube on the styrofoam holder and incu­
bated for 15 min at room temperature prior to analysis. 
The mixture was then measured by F-ISE with a fluoride 
electrode, as described above. Along with samples, 
a series of F− standards were also measured by preparing 
them in the context of corresponding PFAS compounds 
(100 µM) and control extracts from non-PFCA cultures 
to eliminate any possible interferences of fungal meta­
bolites and F− contamination in PFAS stocks. The mV 
readings were plotted logarithmically against F− stan­
dard concentrations (0–124 µM) for calculating the 
calibration curve and for determining the F− concentra­
tion in samples.
19F NMR analysis.—Fungal samples were prepared 
with 90% aqueous sample and 10% D2O for PFAS 
quantification with 19F NMR (nuclear magnetic reso­
nance) spectroscopy. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was 
added to each sample at a final concentration of 
100 µM as an internal reference. Samples were vor­
texed to mix, and 700 µL was transferred to thin 
wall, 5 mm, 7 inch length, 500 MHz precision NMR 
tubes (Wilmad 528-PP-7-5; Sigma Aldrich) using 
Pasteur pipettes for measurement. 19F spectra were 
acquired using Bruker Avance III HD 400 MHz 
spectrometer 
with 
SampleXpress 
autosampler 
(University of Minnesota facility) without proton 
decoupling. A delay time of 3 s and 450 scans was 
experimentally determined to provide a sufficient 
signal-to-noise ratio and relaxation. MestReNova 
software was used for spectral processing (Mnova 
15.1). Each spectrum was phase-corrected, baselined 
using Whittaker smoother, and referenced to TFA 
(−76.55 ppm). Integration and chemical shifts were

centrations of PFAS were calculated using the 
following equation: 
where Cx is the concentration of PFAS, Ix is the integral of 
–CF3 group of PFAS, Is is the integral of –CF3 group of 
TFA, Ns is the number of the –CF3 group of TFA, Nx is 
the number of the –CF3 group of PFAS, and Cs is the 
concentration of internal control TFA.
Statistical analysis.—At least three bioreplicates were 
used in this work to allow the statistical analysis. Mean 
values and standard deviations were presented. Two-tailed 
paired t-tests were used to establish significant differences 
when required, given unequal variances among the various 
treatments. Logarithmic regression modeling was used for 
calculating the F− calibration curves of ISE measurements.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Tolerance to PFCA chemicals is a variable fungal 
trait influenced by taxonomic clade and decay 
type.—Given that a fungus’s ability to resist chemical 
toxins can reflect its biodegradative capacity (Mao and 
Guan 2016; Nesse et al. 2023), we assessed the tolerance 
of different wood decay fungi to PFCAs, aiming to identify 
suitable species for further studies on deF. We tested 
species from six clades within the Agaricomycotina sub­
division of the Basidiomycota that represent two primary 
decay types, brown rot and white rot (Zhang et al. 2019), 
for their mycelial growth in the presence or absence of 
PFOA, a legacy PFCA chemical (FIG. 1). Our findings 
revealed that the effects of PFOA on hyphal growth are 
species specific; some fungi, such as Leucogyrophana mol­
lusca, experienced a significant reduction in growth rates 
by 80–100%, whereas others, such as Ganoderma austral 
and Trametes versicolor, showed no inhibition from PFOA 
exposure (FIG. 1A). Further analysis indicated that the 
fungal sensitivity to PFOA depends on both taxonomic 
classification and wood decay type. Generally, fungi from 
the Agaricales and Polyporales clades appeared more resis­
tant to PFOAs. However, there was considerable variability 
within the Polyporales group, where wood decay types also 
contribute to the differences among intragroup species. 
Conversely, fungi from the Boletales clade and earlydiverged Agaricomycotina, such as Russulales and 
Hymenochaetales, were more susceptible to PFOA toxicity 
(FIG. 1B). When comparing decay types, brown rot fungi 
were inhibited by PFOA by an average of 58%, which is 
significantly more (5 times, with a t-test P-value of 0.026) 
than the inhibition observed in white rot fungi. This higher 
resistance in white rot fungi may be linked to their unique 
Figure 1. Comparison of growth rates of wood decay fungal species with PFOA supplementation. A. Eighteen wood decay fungal 
species distributed in six different Agaricomycota clades and possessing two primary wood decay types (“white-rot”—blue 
sporophore symbol; “brown-rot”—brown sporophore symbol) were cultured on Highley’s minimum medium plates supplemented 
with either 10 g/L glucose or 10 g/L glucose + 500 mg/L PFOA (i.e., 1.2 mM PFOA) for monitoring the radial growth of hyphal colonies. 
Mean values ± standard deviations of three bioreplicates are shown. B, C. The inhibitory rates by PFOA were calculated relative to the 
growth on glucose and were compared among different fungal clades (B) and wood decay types (C). A two-tailed t-test was used to 
calculate the significant difference between defined fungal groups (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01).

ligninolytic system used for lignocellulose degradation, 
which aligns with previous studies proposing that lignino­
lytic enzymes in white rot fungi play a role in PFAS 
transformation (Colosi et al. 2009; Luo et al. 2018; 
Merino et al. 2023). Overall, our results highlight that 
white rot species, particularly those in the Agaricales and 
Polyporales clades, show notable tolerance to the legacy 
PFAS PFOA. Although the specific detoxifying mechan­
isms remain unclear, these resistant patterns offer valuable 
insights for selecting candidate species for the mycoreme­
diation of PFAS. Moreover, this finding could facilitate 
cross-species comparisons in the search for PFAS degra­
dation genes and pathways.
Based on the screening results, we selected a typical 
white rot fungus T. versicolor demonstrating a strong resis­
tance of PFOA to test whether this fungal resistance could 
extend to other PFCAs and legacy PFAS (FIG. 2). We 
investigated eight PFCAs/PFAS with varying chain lengths 
and unsaturated carbons using plate assays, employing 
concentrations ranging from 100 to 300 µM (FIG. 2A 
and B). The results indicated that none of these PFAS 
significantly affected hyphal growth rates or colony 
morphologies on the agar plates at the selected concentra­
tions. Microscopic visualization confirmed that the mor­
phology of the hyphal cells was not altered (data not 
shown). These findings suggest that the white rot fungus 
may possess certain detoxifying mechanisms to cope with 
the diverse structures of fluorinated carbon chemicals.
To diagnose the potential resistance mechanisms, we 
further investigated the responses of T. versicolor to 
fluoride (NaF) (FIG. 2A and B), as the cytotoxicity of 
PFAS can be partially attributed to fluorosis, which 
impairs the functions of essential enzymes by competing 
with metal ions, such as Mg2+, for binding sites 
(Strunecka and Strunecky 2020; Waugh 2019). 
Surprisingly, our assays revealed that T. versicolor was 
tolerant to F− concentrations up to 1.5 mM (28.5 mg/L), 
significantly exceeding the EPA’s maximum contami­
nant level of 4.0 mg/L designed to protect against ske­
letal fluorosis (Us Epa 2015a, 2015b). Moreover, rather 
than displaying an inhibitory effect, we consistently 
observed that the tested concentrations of F− increased 
hyphal growth rates by 50–80% (P < 0.05, as determined 
by a paired, two-tailed t-test). This suggests that the 
fungus may combat fluoride toxicity by accelerating its 
polarized growth. It is known that fluoride, in the form 
of aluminofluoride complexes (AlFx), can activate het­
erotrimeric G proteins, enhancing G protein signaling 
and speeding up phosphoryl transfer reactions 
(Strunecka and Strunecky 2020; Waugh 2019). These 
processes are important for cell metabolism, energy 
transduction, cytoskeletal protein assembly, cell prolif­
eration, aging, and apoptosis. Meanwhile, genetic evi­
dence indicates that the constitutive activation of 
G protein and small GTPase signaling leads to enhanced 
polarized apical growth of hyphal cells (Dautt-Castro 
et al. 2021; Leberer et al. 2001; Tisch et al. 2011; Zhang 
et al. 2012; Zhu et al. 2009). Therefore, it is likely that 
fluoride stimulates fungal growth through a mechanism 
similar to that in this research. Like F−, other investi­
gated PFAS also promoted fungal growth to varying 
degrees until the level of PFOA reached 10 mM, which 
completely inhibited growth (FIG. 2B). In summary, 
although the exact resistance mechanisms remain 
unclear, the evident tolerance of wood decay fungi to 
PFAS and fluoride makes these organisms strong can­
didates for exploring and utilizing relevant biodegrada­
tion processes for PFAS research.

Wood decay fungi preferentially deF PFCA 
chemicals that possess alkenyl carbon structures. 
—After assessing the fungal tolerance to PFCA substances 
and fluoride anions, we investigated whether wood decay 
fungi could degrade PFAS by cleaving the carbon-fluorine 
(C–F) bonds. We first examined the ability of a white rot 
fungus, Trametes versicolor, to deF two legacy PFAS, 
PFOA and PFOS. We included a brown rot fungus, 
Fomitopsis pinicola, and an early-diverged fungus from 
the Agricomycotina group, Stereum hirsutum, for com­
parative analysis across different decay types and clades. 
Our results indicated that all three species showed negli­
gible deF on both PFOA and PFOS over a period of 1 to 
3 weeks (FIG. 3A and B). Similarly, tests conducted on two 
other commonly used commercial PFAS, 6:2 fluorotelo­
mer alcohol (6:2 FTOH) and GenX [2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro2-(heptafluoropropoxy)propanoic acid)], yielded negative 
results as well. Prior research has indicated that certain 
wood decay fungal species can transform 6:2 FTOH into 
5:3 FTCA and other transformation products; however, it 
also highlighted difficulties in detecting fluoride ions 
released into the culture supernatant (Merino et al. 2018,  
2023; Zhou et al. 2023). In our study, considering 
a significant deF is detectable for the “dehalogenated” 
PFAS that are listed and discussed below, we conclude 
that wood decay fungi likely do not have the distinguished 
ability to deF PFAS with the long-carbon, perfluorinated 
alkyl structures, although they may transform these com­
pounds into the formats of fluorinated aldehydes, alcohols, 
and aromatic ring, as detected by mass spectrometry 
(Merino et al. 2018, 2023; Zhou et al. 2023).
It is not surprising that PFAS chemicals with longer 
chain lengths and perfluorinated alkyl carbons are not 
readily dehalogenated by fungi, as the C–F bonds in 
these structures possess higher dissociation energy. 
Therefore, we further investigated a variety of commercial 
PFCAs with alternative structures featuring shorter chains 
and unsaturated carbons, which may lower the energy 
required to break down a C–F bond. Our subsequent 
tests indicated that 4,4-trifluoro-3-(trifluoromethyl)cro­
tonic acid (referred to as “Crotonic” in FIG. 3), 4,5,5-tri­
fluoropent-4-enoic acid (“Enoic”), and 2-(trifluoromethyl) 
acrylic acid (“Acrylic”) underwent defluorination readily, 
except for vinyl trifluoroacetate (“Vinyl”) (FIG. 3). Overall, 
the white rot fungus Polyporales species T. versicolor 
exhibited higher deF rates than the other two species 
shown in FIG. 3A, and these rates increased with longer 
culture times. Variable deF degrees were observed across 
different culture batches, possibly due to differences in 
mycelium condition.
Analyzing the structures of these dehalogenated 
PFCAs revealed that they all share an alkenyl carbon 
bond that is directly linked to the fluorine (as seen in 
Enoic) or to the perfluorinated carbon (as in Crotonic 
and Acrylic). Through an inductive effect, the sp2 
hybridization of the C=C bond can attract electrons 
from the perfluorinated carbon, consequently destabi­
lizing the C–F linkage. Similarly, in poly- or perfluor­
oacetate compounds (e.g., CF₃COOH), the carboxyl 
group attracts electrons from neighboring fluorinated 
carbons (Yue et al. 2021), which may impart charac­
teristics allowing for dehalogenation to the compound. 
The corresponding biochemical pathways involved in 
fungal deF are not yet understood, and it is not known 
whether fungi share a similar aerobic deF mechanism 
proposed for activated sludge microbial communities

(Yu et al. 2022). Nevertheless, our finding supports the 
previously suggested structural model to pave the 
route for future exploitation of the underlying mole­
cular mechanisms of fungal deF. Ongoing research 
will guide future attempts to create alternative formu­
lations for PFAS.
Quantification 
of 
fungal 
removal 
of 
PFCA 
chemicals.—To assess whether fungal deF has led 
to the removal of the parent Crotonic PFCA chemi­
cals, we quantified using 19F NMR the residual con­
centrations of the PFCA after treating it with 
T. versicolor in liquid cultures for 3 weeks (FIG. 4).

Crotonic PFCA (A) or PFOA (B) chemicals after 3 weeks of culture by T. versicolor (T.v). 19F spectra of the –CF3 groups of PFCA chemicals 
and internal control trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) are presented to indicate the removal of parent PFAS. Remaining concentrations of PFCA 
chemicals were calculated, as shown in C. Results from three bioreplicated are presented.

Both ours and others’ research have demonstrated 
that 19F NMR is a robust method for rapidly quanti­
fying PFAS and alleviating potential errors intro­
duced by sample processing and interferences 
caused by the background matrix of the fungal sam­
ples (Camdzic et al. 2021, 2023; Corcoran et al. 2001; 
Lewis et al. 2023; Moody et al. 2001). The results, as 
shown in FIG. 4A and C, confirmed that the 
Crotonic PFCA with an initial concentration of 
100 µM can be completely removed by the fungal 
cultures. Our parallel research suggested that the 
sorption effect only contributes to less than 15% 
removal of Crotonic PFCA (unpublished data); the 
current NMR results thereby indicate that fungal deF 
has caused the significant removal of the parent 
compound. Meanwhile, we quantified the removal 
rates of PFOA by fungal cultures, although it is 
shown as not being readily defluorinable by the deF 
tests. The results showed a reduction of PFOA in its 
concentration by 45.6 ± 1.8% (FIG. 4B and C). 
Inferred from our sorption test that demonstrated 
the 30–40% PFOA removal rates by oven-dried killed 
fungal-wood sawdust material (unpublished data), we 
believe that the PFOA removal by the fungal cultures 
in the current setup is likely due to the sorption 
effect. However, we should be cautious of this con­
clusion, as the previous research conducted with 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium (Zhou et al. 2023) sug­
gested that PFOA could be transformed into other 
products by fungal pathways. Since our current 
research primarily focuses on testing the fungal deF 
phenotypes, the transformation products and the 
relevant biochemical pathways that lead to PFCA 
degradation will be studied in future research.
Solid-state culture enhanced the deF of “Crotonic” 
PFCA.—Wood decay fungi are known to thrive as 
terrestrial organisms in less damp environments 
(Mali et al. 2017; Shimada et al. 1997). We, therefore, 
adjusted the amount of wood sawdust added to the 
medium and studied how culturing them on a solid 
substrate rather than in a liquid medium affected 
fungal deF (FIG. 5). For the readily dehalogenated 
Crotonic PFCA, we found that increased wood con­
centration (i.e., decreased moisture content [MC] of 
the medium) significantly enhanced the deF rates by 
the test fungus Trametes versicolor (P < 0.01, paired 
t-test; FIG. 5A). Notably, under solid-state fermenta­
tion (SSF) conditions (MC = 83%, w/w), we observed 
that 100% of the fluorine could be removed from 
Crotonic PFCA at the original concentration of 
100 µM. In contrast, only a 13.7 ± 0.9% deF rate was 
achieved under semisolid, slurry conditions at MC = 
91%. However, the SSF conditions did not improve 
the deF rates for the other two dehalogenated PFCAs, 
nor for the remaining five PFASs, which showed no 
deF in the liquid culture tests (FIG. 5B). Overall, our 
findings indicated that solid culture condition could 
affect fungal deF of certain PFCAs, but this impact is 
variable among different PFCA chemicals.
This finding regarding solid culture has significant 
implications for future research aimed at exploiting 
PFAS-degrading fungal organisms in contaminated 
environments. Typically, liquid culture is used as the 
default method to assess the degradative capacities of 
environmental microbes. However, some fungal species 
might not thrive in aqueous conditions, which could 
lead to an underestimation of their roles in PFAS bio­
transformation. Therefore, our finding serves as 
Figure 5. Fungal deF test under solid-state culture conditions. A. The deF of 4,4-trifluoro-3-(trifluoromethyl)crotonic acid (initial 
concentration = 100 µM) by Trametes versicolor (T.v) cultures that were supplemented with varying amounts of wood sawdust for

concentration of 100 µM by T. versicolor in solid-state cultures containing 250 g/L wood sawdust. Mean values ± standard deviations

to determine significant differences between group pairs or to compare PFAS treatment with control conditions (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; 
***P < 0.001).

a reminder for researchers to consider how culturing 
conditions can influence the biodegradation of PFAS. 
Additionally, the growth of fungal mycelia on a solid 
substrate may enhance the capture of PFAS from the 
environment. Our recent sorption tests suggest that 
a system combining fungi and wood chips could be 
a promising sorbent for PFAS (data unpublished). 
Overall, SSF culture may offer the potential for a dualfunction treatment approach that involves using lowcost lignocellulosic materials as sorbents for PFAS 
sequestration, followed by fungal degradation or other 
deconstruction methods to achieve sustainable remedia­
tion of PFAS in the environment.
Further discussions on the implications of the 
current research.—Fungi play a crucial role in nutrient 
cycles across various ecosystems. Some fungi have 
developed specialized systems to break down complex 
polymer structures, enabling them to co-metabolize and 
recycle man-made xenobiotics, such as plastics 
(Navarro et al. 2021). For example, wood decay fungi 
have evolved a complex array of hydrolytic and oxida­
tive enzymes that possess broad substrate specificity, 
allowing them to degrade not only lignocellulosic mate­
rials but also xenobiotics (Byss et al. 2008; Chun et al.  
2019; Dinakarkumar et al. 2024; Vipotnik et al. 2021). 
Our research indicates that wood decay fungi, particu­
larly the “white rot” species, can tolerate and degrade 
perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). 
Although the specific biochemical processes involved 
are not yet fully understood, this finding suggests that 
fungi may play a significant role in responding to and 
recycling fluorinated chemicals produced by industrial 
activities. Gaining a better understanding of these fungal 
processes could enhance our knowledge of how natural 
ecosystems respond to the disposal of PFAS.
In addition to their ecological implications, our stu­
dies offer valuable insights into the use of fungal organ­
isms for the remediation of fluorinated carbon (FC) 
chemicals. Unlike bacteria, fungal mycelia can traverse 
air-water interfaces and efficiently colonize and trans­
port nutrients through nonaqueous environments. This 
capability is especially relevant for treating contami­
nated soils or solid wastes, which often present chal­
lenges for bacterial or physicochemical treatment 
methods (Abunada et al. 2020; Bentel et al. 2019; 
Kucharzyk et al. 2017). Furthermore, fungal enzyme 
systems typically exhibit low substrate specificities, 
allowing them to initiate the degradation of toxic com­
pounds (Navarro et al. 2021). This process can enhance 
fungal tolerance to external toxins. In contrast, bacteria 
must be acclimated to develop tolerance and improve 
their proliferation in the presence of pollutants before 
they can effectively conduct degradation experiments. 
Therefore, fungi are particularly well suited for addres­
sing xenobiotic pollutants, including FC chemicals, in 
solid matrices.
With the endorsement of our current findings, several 
important scientific questions warrant further explora­
tion in the continued research. First, our study showed 
that both F− and PFAS at concentrations of 200 µM or 
more, including PFOAs at concentrations up to 1 mM, 
can potentially enhance the polarized hyphal growth of 
some white rot fungi. This observation seems counter­
intuitive, given the common perception of PFAS/F− as 
toxic substances. Therefore, it will be worth further 
investigating the underlying mechanisms that fungi use 
to respond to PFAS to enhance polarized growth. 
Second, the features of fungal tolerance do not entirely 
align with their capacities to degrade PFAS. This is 
evident from their strong tolerance but limited ability 
to degrade legacy, non-defluorinated PFAS. Therefore, it 
would be interesting to explore the relationship between 
these two behaviors—fungal tolerance and the degrada­
tion of PFAS. Third, given the structures of the PFAS 
that fungi can defluorinate, it is worthwhile to investigate 
the functional enzymes and biochemical pathways 
involved in this defluorination process. Although we 
found no evidence of fungi being able to defluorinate 
legacy PFAS (such as PFOA, PFOS, GenX, and 6:2 
FTOH), which are known for their inert and longchain carbon-fluorine (C–F) bonds, we did identify 
some unique functional groups. For instance, the pre­
sence of alkenyl bonds or other electron-attracting 
groups may reduce the dissociation energy of nearby 
C–F bonds, thereby enabling fungal processes to conduct 
defluorination. These findings provide valuable model 
fluorinated carbon structures that can be used to inves­
tigate the mechanisms of defluorination necessary for 
deciphering the processes involved in the fungal degra­
dation of PFAS. Addressing this question could help to 
revisit the ongoing debate regarding the potential roles of 
fungal-derived P450 enzymes and ligninolytic enzymes 
in the biotransformation of PFAS (Luo et al. 2018; 
Merino et al. 2023; Steffens et al. 2023).
CONCLUSIONS
The biodegradation of fluorinated carbon chemicals is 
receiving significant attention due to the environmental 
issues caused by PFAS pollutants. However, the role of 
fungi in degrading and recycling these compounds 
remains largely untapped. In this research, we utilized 
an optimized fluoride ion selective electrode (F-ISE) 
method to investigate the defluorination (deF)

capacities of various fungi on a set of PFAS, which differ 
in carbon chain length, degree of fluorination, and func­
tional groups. We did not find any significant deF 
activity for legacy PFAS, such as fluorotelomer alcohols 
(FTOH) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which had 
previously been reported as degradable by wood decay 
fungi or their enzymes in other studies. However, evi­
dence of fungal tolerance to various PFAS and fluoride 
chemicals was observed, although the exact defense 
mechanism remains to be determined. Our screening 
of 18 different wood decay fungal species suggested that 
this tolerance is most likely linked to white rot fungi, 
which have developed oxidative systems capable of 
mineralizing the resistant structures of lignin. Further 
testing on different PFCA variants identified the fungal 
dehalogenated structures rendered by the electronattracting groups, such as the alkenyl bond near C–F 
bonds, which supports an intriguing “structure-reactiv­
ity” paradigm of PFAS. These insights could aid in the 
development of novel PFCA compounds that are less 
resistant and less environmentally harmful than cur­
rently used chemicals. Furthermore, our findings high­
light the potential of fungal organisms to degrade 
fluorinated compounds and suggest that future research 
on microbial communities should focus on the resident 
fungal communities found in affected environments.
