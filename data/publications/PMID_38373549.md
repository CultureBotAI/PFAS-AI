Abstract
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have already drawn a
lot of attention for their accumulation and reproductive toxicity in
organisms. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanoic
sulfonate (PFOS), two representative PFAS, are toxic to humans and
animals. Due to their widespread use in environmental media with
multiple toxicities, PFOA and PFOS have been banned in numerous
countries, and many substitutes have been produced to meet market
requirements. Unfortunately, most alternatives to PFOA and PFOS
have proven to be cumulative and highly toxic. Of the reported
multiple organ toxicities, reproductive toxicity deserves special
attention. It has been confirmed through epidemiological studies
that PFOS and PFOA are not only associated with reduced
testosterone levels in humans, but also with an association with
damage to the integrity of the blood testicular barrier. In addition,
for women, PFOA and PFOS are correlated with abnormal sex
hormone levels, and increase the risk of infertility and abnormal
menstrual cycle. Nevertheless, there is controversial evidence on the
epidemiological relationship that exists between PFOA and PFOS as
well as sperm quality and reproductive hormones, while the
evidence from animal studies is relatively consistent. Based on the
published papers, the potential toxicity mechanisms for PFOA,

## Page 9

PFOS and their substitutes were reviewed. For males, PFOA and
PFOS may produce reproductive toxicity in the following five ways:
(1) Apoptosis and autophagy in spermatogenic cells; (2) Apoptosis
and differentiation disorders of Leydig cells; (3) Oxidative stress in
sperm and disturbance of Ca2+ channels in sperm membrane; (4)
Degradation of delicate intercellular junctions between Sertoli cells;
(5) Activation of brain nuclei and shift of hypothalamic
metabolome. For females, PFOA and PFOS may produce
reproductive toxicity in the following five ways: (1) Damage to
oocytes through oxidative stress; (2) Inhibition of corpus luteum
function; (3) Inhibition of steroid hormone synthesis; (4) Damage to
follicles by affecting gap junction intercellular communication
(GJIC); (5) Inhibition of placental function. Besides, PFAS
substitutes show similar reproductive toxicity with PFOA and PFOS,
and are even more toxic to the placenta. Finally, based on the
existing knowledge, future developments and direction of efforts in
this field are suggested.
Keywords: PFAS substitutes; PFOA; PFOS; Reproductive toxicity.
