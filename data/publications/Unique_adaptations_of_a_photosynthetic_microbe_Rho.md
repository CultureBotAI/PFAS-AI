Abstract
In this study, we investigate the PFOA removal capabilities of
Rhodopseudomonas palustris (R. palustris), a fluoroacetate
dehalogenase containing microbe, as a potential candidate for
achieving bioremediation. In the 50-day PFOA uptake experiment,
R. palustris removed 44 ± 6.34% PFOA after 20 days of incubation,
which was then reduced to a final removal of 6.23 ± 12.75%.
Results indicate that PFOA was temporarily incorporated into the
cell membrane before being partially released into the media after
cell lysis. This incorporation might be attributed to the combined
effect of the hydrophobic interaction between PFOA and the cell
membrane and the reduced electrostatic repulsion from the high ion
concentration in the growth medium. The growth of R. palustris
during the PFOA uptake experiment was 45-fold slower than their
growth without PFOA. This study also completely defines the
toxicity range of PFOA for R. palustris through a toxicity assay.
Increasing PFOA concentration reduced microbial growth, with
complete inhibition observed at around 200 ppm. An accelerated

growth phase was followed by a temporary death phase in the first
24 hours in the presence of 12.5–100 ppm PFOA, implying a unique
adaptation mechanism to PFOA.
