Significance
Given the incomplete and slow 
biodegradation of a limited 
number of per-­ and polyfluoroalkyl 
substances (PFAS), this work marks 
the endeavor combining PFAS-­
degrading microbial communities 
with state-­of-­the-­art electroactive 
materials for enhanced 
bioremediation. The synergistic 
interactions between biological 
and electrochemical activities 
promoted defluorination in the 
bioelectrochemical system. These 
findings provide critical insights 
into the design and optimization of 
material–microbe hybrid systems 
for PFAS remediation.

Per-­ and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), particularly the perfluorinated ones, are 
recalcitrant to biodegradation. By integrating an enrichment culture of reductive 
defluorination with biocompatible electrodes for the electrochemical process, a deeper 
defluorination of a C6-­perfluorinated unsaturated PFAS was achieved compared to the 
biological or electrochemical system alone. Two synergies in the bioelectrochemical 
system were identified: i) The in-­series microbial-­electrochemical defluorination and ii) 
the electrochemically enabled microbial defluorination of intermediates. These synergies 
at the material–microbe interfaces surpassed the limitation of microbial defluorination 
and further turned the biotransformation end products into less fluorinated products, 
which could be less toxic and more biodegradable in the environment. This material–
microbe hybrid system brings opportunities in the bioremediation of PFAS driven by 
renewable electricity and warrants future research on mechanistic understanding of 
defluorinating and electroactive microorganisms at the material–microbe interface for 
system optimizations.
materials-­microbe interfaces | per-­ and polyfluoroalkyl substances | defluorination
Integrating electrochemically active materials with microorganisms offers a powerful strat­
egy for creating hybrid biological-­inorganic systems and enables many challenging chem­
ical reactions with high efficiency and selectivity (1–5). By combining the unique 
reactivities from both electrochemistry and biochemistry, the material–microbe interface 
that benefits from synthetic and biological catalysts is proposed to yield reactivities that 
were initially difficult to achieve with either materials or microbes alone (4–7). We have 
demonstrated that such material–microbe interfaces are capable of fixing CO2 and N2 
into chemicals, fuels, and fertilizers powered by either sunlight or electricity, with high 
efficiencies and reaction throughputs (8–12). These promising advances propel us to 
explore new applications and new reactivities with the utilization of material–microbe 
interface.
One potential application of the material–microbe interface for enhanced reactivity is 
the defluorination of per-­ and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). PFAS is a large family 
of over 10,000 manufactured chemicals (13), which have raised severe concerns for public 
health and ecosystems in recent decades due to their environmental persistence, widespread 
occurrence, and toxicity (14, 15). While the strong carbon-­fluorine (C−F) bonds endow 
PFAS with extreme chemical and thermal stability for wide applications (16), the same 
property renders PFAS recalcitrant to environmental degradation, thus persistent in the 
environment and imposing adverse effects (17–19). It calls for innovative treatment tech­
nologies and remediation strategies for effective destruction via deep defluorination, where 
an appreciable number of C−F bonds in the molecule are broken with the release of 
fluoride (F−) and the formation of less/nonfluorinated products. Less fluorinated products 
are typically more mobile, less bioaccumulative, and less persistent in the environment 
(20–22), hence deemed to be less toxic. Bioremediation, particularly with naturally occur­
ring microorganisms under environmental conditions, is considered as a more cost-­effective 
and sustainable option for pollutant degradation, including PFAS (23–25). However, 
such a bioremediation strategy is currently challenging due to its slow reaction kinetics 
and incapability of achieving deep defluorination and effective destruction.
Thus, we hypothesize that integrating defluorinating microorganisms with electrochem­
ically active biocompatible materials would address the challenging degradation steps 
unachievable by microbes alone and lead to faster and more effective defluorination 
(Fig. 1A). This approach will not only retain the benefits of bioremediation but also offer 
improved PFAS defluorination performance. We further hypothesize that the potentially 
improved defluorination of such an integrated approach could be attributed to synergies 
from two aspects: i) the electrochemical effect, where the reductive electrochemical driving 
force on the electrode’s surface offers additional electrochemical pathways of PFAS

decomposition and defluorination; ii) the bioelectrochemical 
effect, where the presence of electrochemical material–microbe 
interface may stimulate microbial processes (12, 26) or enable new 
microbial reactivities. The goal of this study was to test those 
hypotheses regarding the beneficial effects of the electrochemically 
driven material–microbe interface, which had not been experi­
mentally demonstrated before.
Here, we report the faster and deeper PFAS defluorination 
thanks to the synergies identified at the electrochemical material–
microbe interface. Neither the electrochemical nor the biological 
system alone could achieve the same performance. E-­perfluo
ro (4-­methylpent-­2-­enoic acid) (PFMeUPA) is one of the two 
perfluorinated structures reported to be reductively biodefluori­
nated by commonly available anaerobic microbial communities, 
and its biotransformation pathways have been elucidated (24, 27, 
28). With PFMeUPA as a model PFAS molecule, we found that 
a hybrid system consisting of microbial consortium and biocom­
patible electrochemical cathode led to a faster release of F– from 
the decomposition of PFMeUPA. Detailed characterization of the 
transformation products (TPs) during this process indicated the 
release of up to 6 F– per PFMeUPA molecule, a much more sig­
nificant extent of defluorination than the microbial approach with 
the release of 1 or 2 F– per PFMeUPA (27). Moreover, the differ­
ences in TP formation between the electrochemical and bioelec­
trochemical systems implied that further defluorinating reactions 
forming less fluorinated products were enabled only at the mate­
rial–microbe interface in the bioelectrochemical system. This 
proof-­of-­concept study demonstrates unique synergies between 
biocatalysis and electrochemistry that lead to faster and deeper 
defluorination and opens avenues of the material–microbe inter­
face to treat challenging water pollutants, including PFAS and 
beyond.
Results
Faster and Deeper Defluorination in the Bioelectrochemical 
System. We integrated a PFMeUPA-­defluorinating microbial 
community (27) with a previously developed biocompatible 
electrochemical system (8, 29) to investigate the defluorination 
performance. The defluorinating anaerobic microbial community 
originated from the dechlorinating microcosm KB-­1 (27) and has 
been maintained with lactate and PFMeUPA for over 5 y (see 
details in the Materials and Methods section). The electrochemical 
system consisted of a cobalt–phosphorus (Co-­P) cathode and 
a cobalt phosphate (CoPi) anode, and a constant voltage of 
−1.4 ± 0.19 V vs. Ag/AgCl was applied to the system for water 
electrolysis (Fig. 1A and SI Appendix, Fig. S1). In the absence of 
the defluorinating enrichment culture, the electrochemical system 
alone did not show defluorination or degradation of PFMeUPA 
(SI Appendix, Fig. S2). However, by inoculating the anaerobic 
PFMeUPA-­defluorinating culture into the closed-­circuit cathodic 
chamber, a fluoride formation of 17.4 ± 2.4 µM was achieved after 
8 d. Such a defluorination performance is significantly higher 
than that in the biological system alone (1.2 ± 0.8 µM fluoride 
formation, Fig. 1B), where the same volume of the same culture 
was inoculated, amended with the same amount of PFMeUPA 
and with H2/CO2 as the headspace. In the biological system, the 
defluorination process did not start until a lag phase of 2 wk. It 
took more than 30 d to reach ~9 µM fluoride release (insertion of 
Fig. 1B), while the bioelectrochemical system doubled the fluoride 
release in half of the time.
We attributed the significantly higher and faster fluoride release 
in the bioelectrochemical system to synergistic effects at the mate­
rial–microbe interface. There are two possible synergies involved 
in the bioelectrochemical system: i) in-­series defluorination, i.e., 
the products of biological defluorination could be further defluor­
inated via abiotic electrochemical processes; ii) microbial defluor­
ination processes could be enhanced at the cathodic electrode that 
holds the material–microbe interface. To demonstrate how each 
scenario contributed to the observed higher and faster defluori­
nation in the bioelectrochemical system, we further introduced 
an abiotic electrochemical system inoculated with 5 mL cell-­free 
spent medium of the same defluorinating enrichment culture as 
inoculated in the bioelectrochemical and biological systems. The 
spent medium was prepared by filtering a portion (~20 mL) of 
the same inoculation culture through a 0.22-­μm filter. Thus, it 
was cell-­free but contained the TPs of PFMeUPA in the defluor­
inating enrichment culture grown on lactate and with three doses 
of 70 μM PFMeUPA. The same bottle of culture was used for the 
inoculation of the three systems (i.e., 5 mL live culture for the 
bioelectrochemical and biological systems and 5 mL spent medium 
for the electrochemical system) for comparison. The same amount 
of PFMeUPA was amended in the three systems (Fig. 2A). By 
comparing the fluoride formation and analyzing the parent com­
pound and TPs, we demonstrated the simultaneous occurrence of 
the two synergies between microbial and electrochemical processes 
in the bioelectrochemical system, which led to significantly higher 
and faster defluorination compared to the biological or electro­
chemical systems alone. In the following two sections, we described 
and interpreted the detailed results indicating that the two

proposed synergies were both observed at the electrochemically 
driven material–microbe interface.
Electrochemical Defluorination of PFMeUPA Biotransformation 
Products at the Material–Microbe Interface in the Bioelectro­
chemical System. We observed abiotic degradation of PFMeUPA 
biotransformation products via electrochemical processes. When the 
cell-­free spent medium containing PFMeUPA biotransformation 
products (TP276, TP256, and TP259) was introduced into the 
electrochemical system containing newly spiked PFMeUPA 
(~70 μM), no removal of PFMeUPA was observed (SI Appendix, 
Fig. S3A) but with nonnegligible fluoride formation (SI Appendix, 
Fig. S3B). Such a fluoride formation could be attributed to the 
electrochemical defluorination of PFMeUPA biotransformation 
products carried over from the spent medium. This indicates 
the first proposed synergy of microbial-­electrochemical in-­series 
defluorination, where biotransformation products were further 
defluorinated by the abiotic electrochemical processes (the 
blue arrow in Fig. 2A). The microbial-­electrochemical in-­series 
defluorination contributed to the previously observed higher 
fluoride formation (Fig. 1B).
In the electrochemical system, one major carry-­over biological end 
product, TP276 (via the biological hydrogenation of PFMeUPA) 
(27), was rapidly degraded (Fig. 2B), likely via the reductive defluor­
ination forming TP259 and the HF elimination into TP256 (Figs. 2 
C and D and 3B). TP259, another major end product of PFMeUPA 
biotransformation (via hydrogenation of the reductive defluorination 
intermediate TP256, -­F+H+2H from PFMeUPA) (27), was further 
defluorinated via HF elimination (Fig. 2C) and resulted in a struc­
turally confirmed intermediate of TP238 (Figs. 2E and 3A). 
Subsequently, several less fluorinated TPs were formed, likely from 
the further transformation of TP238 (Figs. 2F and 3B), suggesting 
deeper defluorination, i.e., more C–F bonds were cleaved per mole­
cule. We confirmed the electrochemical defluorination of TP238 by 
spiking its reference standard into the same electrochemical system, 
and the same TPs (i.e., TP241, TP223, TP205, TP200, and TP169 
in Fig. 3B) detected in the bioelectrochemical system spiked with 
PFMeUPA were formed from the electrochemical degradation of the 
standard compound of TP238 (SI Appendix, Fig. S5).
Overall, the major PFMeUPA biotransformation end products 
in the biological system can be further transformed and defluor­
inated via abiotic electrochemical processes in the bioelectrochem­
ical system (Fig. 3B), demonstrating the synergistic effect via 
microbial-­electrochemical in-­series defluorination at the material–
microbial interface. In the biological system, TP276 and TP259 
were the two major end products from the anaerobic biotransfor­
mation of PFMeUPA. The integration of microorganisms with an 
electrochemical system surpasses the microbial limitation and 
breaks down those two biologically stable products into less fluor­
inated TPs, which could not be achieved by either biological or 
electrochemical systems alone.
Electrochemically Enhanced/Enabled Biotransformation Proces­ses 
in the Bioelectrochemical System. Besides the synergy via microbial 
and electrochemical in-­series defluorination, the second synergistic 
effect via electrochemically enhanced/enabled biotransformation was 
also observed in the bioelectrochemical system. Specific biotrans­
formation processes were electrochemically enhanced, contributing 
to the deeper and faster defluorination of the parent compound. First, 
since the parent compound of PFMeUPA can only be transformed 
biologically (Fig. 2A), the observed faster removal of PFMeUPA 
in the bioelectrochemical system compared to others (SI Appendix, 
Fig. S3A) suggested an enhanced biotransformation of PFMeUPA. 
Similarly, the further biotransformation of TP256 was enhanced in the

bioelectrochemical system since the level of TP256 was higher in the 
biological system compared to the bioelectrochemical system (Fig. 2D).
On top of the electrochemically enhanced microbial transfor­
mation of PFMeUPA, we also observed electrochemically enabled 
biodefluorination of some intermediates such as the HF elimina­
tion of TP259 to form TP238. TP238 cannot be formed from 
PFMeUPA by the biological system alone (27). Although the 
electrochemical system alone also converted TP259 into TP238 
and subsequent TPs, the bioelectrochemical system achieved a 
much faster removal of TP259 (Fig. 2C), corresponding to the 
faster formation of TP238 (Fig. 2E). Thus, it indicated that elec­
trochemically enabled biological processes substantially contrib­
uted to the transformation of TP259 to TP238, and such 
defluorination processes were unique in the bioelectrochemical 
system as the biological system was unable to further decompose 
TP259 (27).
According to a previous study, in the biological system spiked 
with TP238 standard compound, it was only transformed into 
the end product TP241 via hydrogenation without further deg­
radation (27); however, in the bioelectrochemical system, TP241 
was further transformed into less fluorinated TPs, i.e., TP223, 
TP205, TP200, and TP169 (Fig. 3B and SI Appendix, Fig. S6). 
All these downstream TPs could be formed from TP238 via elec­
trochemical defluorination processes (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). 
Given that there were no significant differences in the formation 
of those TPs, except for TP223, between the bioelectrochemical 
and the electrochemical systems (SI Appendix, Fig. S6), it was 
most likely that the electrochemical defluorination played a major 
role in their formation in the PFMeUPA-­spiked bioelectrochem­
ical system. The higher level of TP223 in the bioelectrochemical 
system (Fig. 2F) was probably due to more TP238 formed 
(Fig. 2E) from the electrochemically enabled biodefluorination 
of TP259.
Shift of Community Structure at the Material–Microbe Interface 
of the Bioelectrochemical System. The electrochemically enhanced 
and enabled biological processes suggested that specific microbial 
groups were selected in the bioelectrochemical system. Therefore, 
we conducted the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to examine 
the changes in the composition of microbial communities in the 
bioelectrochemical system compared to the one in the biological 
system (Fig. 4A). Since the same cathode material was also added to 
the biological system, we divided the microbial community in the 
biological and bioelectrochemical systems into two groups: the one

in planktonic growth (i.e., entries 1 and 3 for the biological and 
the bioelectrochemical system, respectively) and the one attached 
to the cathode material (i.e., entries 2 and 4 for the biological and 
the bioelectrochemical system, respectively) (Fig. 4A). Differences 
in microbial compositions of those communities were examined 
using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.
We observed significant differences in microbial distributions 
and community compositions between the biological and bioel­
ectrochemical systems. First, in the biological system, microorgan­
isms were distributed both in suspension and on the cathode 
surface with similar community structures. Different from the 
biological system, in the bioelectrochemical system with the addi­
tion of electricity, microorganisms were prone to attach to the 
cathode materials, with only a small amount of genomic DNAs 
extracted from the cells collected from the culture suspension (i.e., 
only one out of the four replicates retrieved sufficient DNA for the 
sequencing analysis as shown in entry 3 in Fig. 4B). The planktonic 
community in the bioelectrochemical system (entry 3) also revealed 
a similar taxonomic distribution to the cathode-­attached commu­
nity (entry 4 in Fig. 4B). The similar compositions of the plank­
tonic and surface-­bound communities in the same system suggested 
that physical adsorption to the cathode material did not signifi­
cantly alter community structures. Instead, the addition of elec­
tricity altered the space distribution of microorganisms by 
promoting cell attachment to the cathode. Second, we observed a 
substantial shift of community composition from the biological 
system after introducing electricity on the cathode, which was 
consistent with the results from scanning electron miscopy 
(SI Appendix, Fig. S8). A specific taxonomic group (TAXA1) in 
the genus Clostridium became dominant in the community bound 
to the electricity-­applied cathode surface with an average relative 
abundance of 80% compared to 29% in the biological system 
without the electric circuit applied. Meanwhile, the most dominant 
taxonomic group in the biological system, TAXA2 (an unspecified 
Clostridiales family bacterium), was outcompeted to near extinction 
in the bioelectrochemical system. Although TAXA1 and TAXA2 
were the closest among all abundant taxonomic groups, they only 
had 87.5% similarity of the 16S rRNA gene (Fig. 4C) and could 
be quite different in physiological characteristics and electroactive 
properties given their different responses to the addition of 
electricity.
Discussion
An electricity-­driven material–microbe system uniquely achieved 
faster and deeper defluorination of PFMeUPA compared to the 
biological or electrochemical system alone, which were contributed 
by two types of synergies at the electrochemically driven micro­
bial–material interface. First, the major stable products of 
PFMeUPA (i.e., TP276 and TP259) from biological processes 
were able to be further transformed via electrochemical processes, 
partially contributing to the formation of less fluorinated TPs, 
hence higher defluorination. Second, unique electrochemically 
enhanced and enabled biological processes contributed to the faster 
degradation of PFMeUPA as well as the higher formation of less 
fluorinated TPs (e.g., TP238 and TP223). Collectively, the two 
synergies elucidated in the as-­demonstrated bioelectrochemical 
system together achieved up to six F─ released from each parent 
compound molecule, which is much higher than one F─ released 
in the biological system alone (27).
The TP analysis highlighted the unique electrochemically enabled 
biodefluorination reactions, such as the formation of TP238 from 
TP259 (one stable product in the biological system alone), which 
is a key step leading to further electrochemical defluorination. 
However, it is still unclear which microorganisms could benefit from 
the electrochemically active cathodic environment and obtain the 
new capability. The dominant Clostridium spp. in the microbial 
community of the bioelectrochemical system were likely the elec­
troactive ones similar to those Clostridium species, Clostridium cochlearium, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium ljungdahlii, and 
Clostridium aceticum, known to be electroactive in other bioelec­
trochemical systems (31–33). All reported PFAS biotransformation 
so far, including the aerobic transformation of polyfluorinated com­
pounds and the reductive defluorination of the perfluorinated 
PFMeUPA, did not support cell growth (20–22, 24, 34–38). This 
makes it more challenging to identify the responsible ones by simply

comparing community differences between the biological and bio­
electrochemical systems. Nonetheless, we may still reasonably infer 
that the dominant microbes attached to the cathode surface could 
be plausible candidates for screening in future studies. A recent 
report on certain acetogens capable of PFMeUPA reductive defluor­
ination might also provide some insights into the future identifica­
tion of the responsible microorganisms in the bioelectrochemical 
system (28). It is also worth noting that the transformation of 
PFMeUPA could only be realized by microbial processes. Thus, 
ensuring continuous biodegradation of PFMeUPA, in other words, 
sustained growth of the degrading microorganisms in the bioelec­
trochemical system, is pivotal. Despite the enhanced defluorination 
degree of PFMeUPA in the bioelectrochemical system, we observed 
slowed PFMeUPA degradation over time, suggesting a decrease in 
microbial activities. As the microorganisms capable of reductive 
defluorination are being identified and characterized (28), we point 
future directions toward optimizing the bioelectrochemical system 
by selecting and utilizing more efficient defluorinating microbial 
cultures and operating in their favorable growth conditions after a 
better understanding of the physiological and molecular character­
istics of the defluorinating microbes.
The PFAS compound used in this proof-­of-­concept study rep­
resents an important group of PFAS (i.e., unsaturated ones), which 
have been synthesized as the building blocks and key intermediates 
in the organofluorine industry (15, 39–42). Compared to the 
biological system that only worked with per-­ and polyfluorinated 
unsaturated structures (24), the bioelectrochemical system enabled 
defluorination of a wider range of PFAS compounds with different 
structures, suggesting its transformative potential to be adapted 
to other PFAS compounds. Complete defluorination leading to 
benign products would be the ultimate treatment goal, but it is 
very challenging. In the current bioelectrochemical system, 
although the parent compound was not fully mineralized, the 
bioelectrochemically enhanced defluorination resulted in less 
fluorinated products, which tend to be less toxic and less persistent 
in the environment. Overall, the demonstrated bioelectrochemical 
system opens another route for degrading the notorious PFAS 
compounds with an extension of the slow and limited defluori­
nation process in biological systems, casting light on future designs 
of defluorination systems with unique synergies at the material–
microbial interface to enhance PFAS destruction.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals. Standard compounds of (E)-­perfluoro(4-­methylpent-­2-­enoic acid) 
(denoted “PFMeUPA” (27), CAS number:103229-­89-­6), and 4,5,5,5-­tetrafluoro
-­4-­(trifluoromethyl)-­2-­ pentenoic acid (CAS number: 243139-­64-­2) were purchased from SynQuest Laboratories (Alachua, FL). A 10 mM stock solution of each 
standard was prepared in autoclaved anaerobic Milli-­Q water in a 160-­mL sealed 
serum bottle and stored at room temperature until use.
Cultures and Growth Conditions. The defluorinating enrichment originated 
from KB-­1® generously provided by SiREM Lab (https://www.siremlab.com/) and 
has been maintained in Men’s lab since 2017. The cultures for inoculation were 
maintained in 160-­mL sealed serum bottles containing 100 mL of a sterile anaerobic basal medium buffered at pH 7.0 to 7.5 with 100 μg/L vitamin B12 and an 
Ar/CO2 headspace (SI Appendix, Table S1) (43, 44). Lactate (20 mM) was added 
as the electron donor and the primary growth substrate. PFMeUPA (~70 µM) was 
added as the external electron acceptor and re-­added upon depletion (indicated 
by ~70 µM fluoride formation) till three doses. All cultures were incubated at 
34 °C in a dark incubator without shaking. The microbial viability was examined 
by measuring fluoride ion formation from the spiked PFMeUPA.
Electrode Plating. The CoPi and Co-­P alloy electrodes were prepared by electrochemical deposition following the previously reported method (8). The electrochemical deposition was conducted in a three-­electrode system with a working electrode 
of electrode substrate, a counter electrode of Pt wire (CH Instrument CHI115), and a 
reference electrode of Ag/AgCl (1 M KCl) (CH Instrument CHI111P) with the Gamry 
Interface 1000E potentiostat. The deposition solution of the CoPi electrode contains 
10 mM Co(NO3)2 and 0.1 M methylphosphonate (MePi) buffer (pH 8). The carbon 
cloth (Fuel Cell Earth CC6P40), which was sequentially rinsed with acetone and DI 
water, was applied as electrode substrates. The deposition was performed at 0.85 V 
vs. reference until 500 mC/cm2 charge was passed. The deposition solution of the 
CoP electrode contains 0.15 M H3BO3, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.33 M Na2H2PO2, and 0.2 M 
CoCl2. The stainless mesh (AlfaFisher 45002-­CH), which was sequentially rinsed 
with acetone and DI water, was applied as electrode substrates. The deposition was 
performed at −1.2 V vs. reference for 15 min.
Bioelectrochemical System Setup. Experiments of bulk electrolysis were 
­conducted in a custom-­made two-­chamber glass electrochemical cell (Adams and 
Chittenden Scientific Glass). It had two 150-­mL chambers separated by a Nafion 
117 membrane (Sigma-­Aldrich 274674-­1). The experiments were run in parallel 
using an eight-­channel Gamry Interface 1000E potentiostat interfaced with a Gamry 
ECMB multiplexer. The incubation temperature was 30 °C, which was maintained by 
a water bath with constant stirring of 150 rpm under a pure N2 gas atmosphere. The 
working electrode was a stainless-­steel mesh electrodeposited with CoP alloy catalyst 
(“Electrode Plating”), the counter electrode was the carbon cloth electrodeposited 
with CoPi catalyst (Electrode Plating), and the reference electrode was the leak-­free 
Ag/AgCl reference electrode (Innovative Instruments, Inc. LF-­1-­100). The cathodic 
chamber was flushed with pure N2 gas, and then, 95 mL of modified BAV1 medium 
containing ~70 µM PFMeUPA was transferred anaerobically into the cathodic 
chamber. The reducing agent, sodium sulfide + L-­cysteine (SI Appendix, Table S1), 
was added as needed to maintain the anaerobic condition. Then, in the triplicated 
bioelectrochemical system, 5 mL of 100 mL maintained inoculation culture (after 
three doses of PFMeUPA) was injected into the cathodic chamber to make the final 
electrolysis suspension/solution. The anodic chamber contained 100 mL of modified 
BAV1 medium only. Multiplexed chronoamperometry was performed on the reactors 
under the selected voltage to yield the targeted current densities (~1 mA/cm2).
The electrochemical system was set up in triplicates in the same way as the 
bioelectrochemical system, except that 5 mL spent medium (0.22 μm filtrate of 
the same culture used for inoculating the bioelectrochemical system) was inoculated into the cathodic chamber instead of the living culture. The biological system 
was set up in triplicates by inoculating 5 mL of the same culture used for the 
bioelectrochemical system into 160 mL sealed serum bottles containing 95 mL of 
modified BAV1 medium (SI Appendix, Table S1). A pure H2 headspace was used to 
mimic the headspace of the cathodic chamber in the bioelectrochemical system, 
and the same cathode material used in the bioelectrochemical system was added 
to the serum bottle. The addition of the cathode material in the biological system 
was to examine its effect on microbial activities and the microbes attached to it.
Two mL liquid from the cathodic and anodic chambers of the bioelectrochemical and electrochemical systems and the biological system was taken by syringes 
on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8. The samples were centrifugated at 13,000 rpm for 
15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was stored at 4 °C for F–, parent compound, and 
TP analyses, while the cell pellets were kept at −20 °C for the 16S rRNA gene 
amplicon sequencing. At the end of the experiment, the cathode material in the 
bioelectrochemical and biological systems was taken out and stored at −20 °C 
for the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.
Potential adsorption of PFMeUPA and its TPs (i.e., TP276, TP256, and TP259) 
was tested (SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods), and no adsorption was observed. 
Fluoride and other anionic compounds were rejected by the cation-­exchange 
membrane and not detected in the anodic chamber, except PFMeUPA, TP256, and 
TP259. A modified SPE protocol (SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods) was applied 
to extract those compounds from the anodic samples to remove the salts. Total 
peak areas of samples from both chambers were reported for those compounds.
Fluoride-­Ion Measurement by the Ion-­Selective Electrode Method. 
Fluoride ion was measured using an ion-­selective electrode (ISE) (HACH). The 
detection limit was 0.02 mg/L (ca. 1 µM). The fluoride measurement by ISE was 
previously cross-­validated using ion chromatography (27).

a high-­resolution quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer (UHPLC-­HRMS/MS, 
Q Exactive, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). A 2 µL sample was loaded 
onto a Hypersil Gold column (particle size 1.9 µm, 2.1 × 100 mm, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) and eluted at 0.30 mL/min with water (A) and methanol (B), each containing 10 mM ammonium acetate. The linear gradient was 95% A for 0 to 1 min, 
5% A for 6 to 8 min, and 95% A for 8 to 10 min. Samples were analyzed by a full 
scan (m/z 50 to 750) at a resolution of 140,000 (m/z 200) under the negative 
electrospray ionization mode. The suspect and nontarget screening procedure 
was described in SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods.
16S rRNA Gene Amplicon Sequencing Analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted 
from the biomass growing in suspension and attached to the cathode material 
in both the bioelectrochemical and biological systems. The DNA samples were 
sent to Laragen (Culver, CA) for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing using 
MiSeq PE250. The primers targeting the V3-­4 region of the 16S rRNA gene 
were used, i.e., forward primer 5′-­CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG and reverse primer 
5′-­GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC. Sequences were analyzed on the microbiome bioinformatics platform QIIME 2 v2022.2 (https://qiime2.org/). Raw sequences (45) 
were first imported into QIIME 2 and subject to assembly, quality control (with a 
minimum quality score of 25), and feature table construction using DADA2. The 
obtained amplicon sequencing variances were further clustered into operational 
taxonomic units (OTUs) with a minimum of 99% similarity. The most abundant 
sequence was automatically selected as the representative sequence for each 
specific OTU. The closest taxonomy (TAXA) at the genus level was assigned to 
each OTU using gg-­13-­8-­99-­515-­806-­nb-­classifier. Each TAXA may contain 
multiple OTUs (SI Appendix, Table S2 and Fig. S6) due to the low resolution of 
the taxonomic level.
Data, Materials, and Software Availability. The 16S rRNA amplicon sequen­cing 
raw reads were deposited to the National Center for Biotechnology Information 
(NCBI) BioProject (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject) under the accession 
number PRJNA913546. All other data are included in the manuscript and/or
