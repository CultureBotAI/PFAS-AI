Abstract
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid
(PFOS) have attracted global attention due to their chemical
durability, wide distribution, biotoxicity and bioaccumulative
properties. Persulfate is a promising alternative to H2O2 for
advanced oxidation processes and effective for organic removal. In
this review, persulfate activation methods and operational factors in
persulfate-based PFOA / PFOS degradation are analyzed and
summarized. Moreover, the decomposing mechanisms of PFOA and
PFOS are outlined in terms of molecular structures based a series of
proposed pathways. PFOS could be converted to PFOA with the
attack of SO4- and OH. And then PFOA defluorination occurs with
one CF2 unit missing in each round and the similar procedure
would occur continuously with sufficient SO4- and OH until entire
decomposition. In addition, several knowledge gaps and research
needs for further in-depth studies are identified. This review
provides an overview for better understanding of the mechanisms
and prospects in persulfate-based degradation of PFOA and PFOS.
Keywords: AOPs; Defluorination; PFOA; PFOS; Persulfate.
