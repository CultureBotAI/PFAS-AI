Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a persistent and bioaccumulative compound within the broader class of per- and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), poses a significant challenge to environmental remediation efforts due to its 
chemical stability and resistance to conventional treatments. This study explores the potential of bacterial strains 
isolated from a historically petroleum-contaminated site for PFOA biodegradation. Among the three isolates 
enriched and screened in mineral medium supplemented with 100 mg L⁻¹ PFOA, strain OA1 showed the highest 
resistance and transformation potential. The selected isolate was identified as Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila 
OA1. Batch and fed-batch experiments conducted in enriched medium containing 0.5 mg L⁻¹ PFOA showed no 
apparent toxicity, with S. acidaminiphila OA1 maintaining stable growth over a 30-day period. PFOA degradation 
reached 45 % under batch conditions, while fed-batch showed lower transformation rates (35 %). ¹H NMR 
spectroscopy suggested the transformation mechanism of PFOA by S. acidaminiphila OA1. This work represents 
the first report of PFOA biotransformation by Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila and contributes to the expanding 
body of knowledge on microbial interactions with perfluorinated compounds.
1. Introduction
The extensive use of fluorinated organic compounds in a variety of 
applications such as refrigerants, surfactants, lubricants, pharmaceuti­
cals, pesticides, and aqueous film-forming foams has led to their wide­
spread release into the environment [10,49]. Among these, 
perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; C₇F₁₅COOH) stands out as a synthetic 
long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid belonging to the broader 
group of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) [30]. PFOA’s 
amphiphilic nature, along with its exceptional chemical and thermal 
stability, attributed to its fully fluorinated carbon chain and terminal 
carboxylate group, has underpinned its extensive industrial and com­
mercial use since the 1950s. PFOA has been widely used in producing 
stain-resistant coatings, firefighting foams, and various industrial 
products, as well as in synthesizing fluoropolymers like PTFE for 
non-stick and waterproof materials [18,25].
PFOA has become a contaminant of global concern due to its wide­
spread environmental presence, bioaccumulative nature, and harmful 
effects on both human and ecological health [31,44]. National 
monitoring of U.S. tap water (2016–2021) reported cumulative PFAS 
concentrations ranging from 0.35 to 346 ng L⁻¹ , with PFOA detected in 
~15 % of samples and ranking among the most frequently observed 
compounds [39]. In parallel, a nationwide multi-site study of commu­
nities with PFAS-contaminated drinking water (2019–2023) reported 
elevated serum PFOA concentrations compared with national averages 
from NHANES 2017–2020, underscoring ongoing human exposure risks 
[32].
In reaction to growing concerns, major manufacturers such as 3 M 
voluntarily began phasing out PFOA production between 2000 and 2002 
[29]. More recently, 3 M announced its plan to cease all PFAS 
manufacturing by the end of 2025 [33]. In addition, the U.S. Environ­
mental Protection Agency (EPA) recently established legally enforceable 
drinking water standards, setting Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) 
at 4 ppt for PFOA and PFOS, and 10 ppt for PFNA, PFHxS, and GenX 
(HFPO-DA), with monitoring requirements beginning in 2027 and full 
compliance by 2029 [45].
Conventional PFAS remediation strategies have largely relied on 
physical and chemical techniques, including adsorption using granular

activated carbon or ion exchange resins, membrane-based filtration 
methods such as reverse osmosis and nanofiltration, and destructive 
processes like incineration, sonolysis, and advanced oxidation [35,36]. 
While these methods are effective under controlled conditions, they are 
frequently associated with high operational costs, elevated energy de­
mands, and complex maintenance requirements, limiting their scal­
ability and accessibility in real-world environmental contexts [15,48]. 
Considering these limitations, biologically based remediation strategies 
are gaining attention as potentially low-cost, environmentally sustain­
able alternatives. However, their application is still limited by slow 
degradation rates in some cases, incomplete mineralization that may 
lead to the accumulation of more toxic intermediate products campared 
to the parental contaminant, and challenges in scaling under uncon­
trolled field conditions such as variable temperature, fluctuating pH, as 
well as presence of competing contaminants [28,37]. Bacterial species 
capable of transforming and/or defluorinating PFAS have been isolated 
from a wide range of environments, including rivers, lakes, marine 
sediments, contaminated soils near industrial facilities and landfills, as 
well as sewage and wastewater treatment plant effluents [3]. These 
strains have been studied under various redox conditions (aerobic, 
anaerobic, and anoxic) using specialized enrichment culture media to 
assess their degradation capabilities. For instance, Pseudomonas aerugi­
nosa achieved a 27.9 % transformation of PFOA at an initial concen­
tration of 10 mg L⁻¹ under aerobic conditions (96 h, ~30 ◦C, pH 7.0), 
while Pseudomonas putida converted 19.0 % under the same conditions 
[9]. In another study, Dietzia aurantiaca completely degraded 6:2 fluo­
rotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS) at ~70 mg L−1 under aerobic conditions 
(200 rpm at room temperature over 32 days) [26]. Additionally, Deha­
lococcoides mccartyi and Moraxella sp. strain B have also been identified 
for their potential in PFAS degradation, although specific degradation 
efficiencies and experimental conditions were not detailed in their 
respective studies [53].
Although several PFAS-degrading bacterial strains have been iden­
tified, the overall diversity and availability of effective PFOA-degrading 
microorganisms remain limited. Known strains often show low degra­
dation efficiency and suffer growth inhibition when exposed to high 
concentrations of the compound as the sole carbon source [3,37,46]. 
The isolation of new strains therefore offers the opportunity to expand 
our understanding of microbial diversity involved in PFAS degradation 
and to uncover novel biodegradation capabilities and mechanisms. This 
study aimed to identify bacterial strains capable of degrading PFOA and 
to evaluate their degradation efficiency under comparative conditions. 
Further analysis sought to gain insights into the degradation kinetics and 
the biotransformation process of PFOA.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Standard chemicals of PFOA and media
PFOA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, ON, Canada) 
and used for microbial culture and standard solutions in LC-MS/MS 
analysis. Perfluoro-n-[1,2-13C2]octanoic acid was purchased from 
Wellington Laboratories (Guelph, ON, Canada) and used for internal 
standard in LC-MS/MS analysis. PFOA-stock solutions at 100 and 
500 mg L−1 were prepared with ultrapure water for the isolation and the 
biodegradation assays. Mineral salts medium (MSM) was prepared with 
the following composition (per liter of ultrapure water): 5 g NH4NO3, 1 g 
KH2PO4, 2 g K2HPO4, 0.5 g MgSO4⋅7 H2O, 2 g NaCl, 0.05 g CaCl2⋅2 H2O, 
pH 7.0 ± 0.2 [52]. Luria-Bertani (LB) medium, used for both plating and 
liquid cultures, was prepared with 10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, and 
10 g NaCl per liter of ultrapure water, adjusted to pH 7.0 ± 0.2. For solid 
media, agar was added at a concentration of 15 g L⁻¹ .
2.2. Screening and selection of PFOA-degrading strain
A soil sample, considered a potential source of PFOA-degrading 
microorganisms, was collected from a historically petroleumcontaminated industrial site near the Port of Montreal, Canada. 5 % 
(w/v) soil suspension was prepared in sterile MSM supplemented with 
0.1 % yeast extract and 0.1 mg L−1 of PFOA. The slurry was incubated at 
30 ± 1 ◦C under continuous shaking (150 rpm) for 7 days. To enrich 
PFOA-degrading microbes, sequential subculturing was conducted by 
transferring 5 % (v/v) of the pre-enriched culture into fresh MSM con­
taining 0.1 % yeast extract and incrementally increasing PFOA concen­
trations (1, 10, and 100 mg L−1). Each subculture cycle lasted 7 days 
under the same incubation conditions. In the final enrichment step, the 
bacterial community was subcultured in MSM amended solely with 
100 mg L−1 PFOA [52]. This concentration is considered high and exerts 
toxic effects on microbial communities; thus, strains capable of growing 
at this level were considered as PFOA-resistant [20]. After four enrich­
ment cycles, acclimated cultures were serially diluted and plated onto 
both PFOA-supplemented LB and MSM agar plates to isolate individual 
colonies.
Following isolation, the strains were screened for PFOA resistance by 
culturing individually in a 100 mg L−1 PFOA-MSM at 30 ± 1 ◦C for 
165 h. Individual colonies of the isolated strains were pre-cultured in LB 
medium at 30 ± 1 ◦C under orbital shaking (150 rpm) overnight. Bac­
terial cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min) and 
rinsed 3 times with a sterile phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) [PBS; 
composed (per liter) of 8 g NaCl, 0.2 g KCl, 1.44 g Na2HPO4, 0.24 g 
KH2PO4,]. Each of the obtained cells were resuspended in 50 mL of fresh 
MSM to achieve a target inoculum density of 10⁷ CFU mL⁻¹ . Experi­
mental flasks were then amended with 100 mg L⁻¹ PFOA and incubated 
under identical conditions. Cultures were sampled at 0, 22, 45, 69, 93, 
and 165 h to monitor bacterial growth via optical density at 600 nm 
(OD600 nm) [34]. Experiments were performed in duplicate.
2.3. PFOA-biodegradation tests using monoculture and consortium
The isolated strains were assessed for PFOA degradation potential by 
culturing individually, and as a consortium, in LB liquid medium sup­
plemented with 0.5 mg L⁻¹ PFOA. Pre-culture cell densities were quan­
tified by 10-fold serial dilution and plate counting (triplicate). Based on 
these counts, the required inoculum volume was added to obtain a 
starting density of 10⁷ CFU mL⁻¹ , and the total working volume of each 
assay was adjusted to exactly 50 mL with LB medium. For the con­
sortium, the inoculum volume for each strain was adjusted based on its 
measured CFU mL⁻¹ to ensure equal contributions of viable cells, 
resulting in a combined starting density of 10⁷ CFU mL⁻¹ , consistent 
with the monocultures. All cultures were incubated at 30 ± 1 ◦C with 
continuous shaking (150 rpm) [9]. Samples were collected at 0, 7, 15, 
and 20 days, with corrections applied for evaporation losses based on 
pre- and post-sampling flask weights at each sampling interval [56]. 
Residual PFOA concentrations were quantified via LC-MS/MS 
(described below). Experiments were performed in duplicate, with 
abiotic control (no inoculum), and results are expressed as mean ±
standard deviation. Statistical significance was assessed using two-way 
ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) followed by the Siegel–Tukey post hoc 
test, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Analyses were performed with 
SigmaPlot version 11. The strain demonstrating the highest degradation 
efficiency, designated strain OA1, was selected for further experiments.
2.4. Identification of selected isolate
Identification of the bacterial isolate was performed through 16S 
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing, following procedures 
described in a previous study [27]. Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted 
from freshly cultured isolates using the NucleoSpin® Microbial DNA kit 
(Macherey–Nagel, Germany). DNA concentration and purity were 
assessed using a Tecan NanoQuant Plate™ (Austria). The 16S rRNA gene 
was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a thermal 
cycler 
(Eppendorf, 
Germany) 
and 
universal 
primers

(5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and 1492 R (5′-TACGGYTACCTTG 
TTACGACTT-3′). PCR products were purified using the QIAquick® PCR 
Purification Kit (Qiagen, Germany), then sequenced at the DNA 
sequencing facility of the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (Ottawa, 
Canada). The resulting sequences were compared against the NCBI 
GenBank 16S rRNA database using the BLAST algorithm. A sequence 
identity of greater than 99 % was required for species-level identifica­
tion. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using MEGA7 software, 
employing the neighbor-joining method [27]. The purified strain was 
preserved in 25 % (v/v) glycerol and stored at −80 ◦C for long-term 
viability.
2.5. PFOA-biodegradation tests using OA1 strain
PFOA degradation was assessed under two operational modes [24]. 
In the batch mode, the system was closed, with no additional nutrients 
provided throughout the experiment. In contrast, the fed-batch mode 
operated as a semi-open system, in which sterile LB medium (10 % v/v) 
was aseptically added every 7–10 days to maintain metabolic activity 
over time. Strain OA1 was first cultured in LB medium at 30 ± 1 ◦C with 
orbital shaking (150 rpm) for 32–48 h to reach the mid-exponential 
growth phase. The cell concentration was determined by standard 
plate counts, and experimental cultures were inoculated to achieve 
target initial cell densities of 10⁷, 10⁸, 10⁹, and 10 ¹ ⁰ CFU mL⁻¹ . No 
washing step was required before inoculation, as the composition of the 
pre-culture and experimental medium (LB) was identical. All tests were 
conducted in 125 mL sterilized Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 mL of LB 
medium amended with 0.5 mg L⁻¹ PFOA. Preliminary tests confirmed 
that shaking at 150 rpm for 125 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 mL 
working volume provided sufficient aeration, and no signs of oxygen 
limitation were observed under these conditions. Cultures were incu­
bated at 30 ± 1 ◦C with continuous shaking for 30 days. Experiments 
were performed in triplicate, alongside abiotic controls (no inoculum) 
and cell growth controls (no PFOA), and results are presented as mean ±
standard deviation. Differences among conditions were assessed using 
two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test, with significance set 
at p < 0.05 (SigmaPlot v11). Culture purity and density were evaluated 
through regular plating on LB. Aliquots (1 mL) were collected at 0, 7, 15, 
20, and 30 days, with corrections applied for evaporation losses based 
on pre- and post-sampling flask weights [56]. Residual PFOA concen­
trations were quantified via LC-MS/MS. The degradation efficiency (%) 
was calculated using the Equation (1):
Degradation efficiency (%) =C0−Ct
C0
× 100 Eq.(1)
where C₀ is the initial concentration (mg L⁻¹), and Cₜ is the concen­
tration at time t (mg L⁻¹). This equation expresses the percentage of 
PFOA removed from the aqueous phase over the course of the 
experiment.
The relationship between PFOA removal efficiency and cultivation 
time for strain OA1 was modeled using linear regression.
2.6. Quantification of PFOA
Samples from cultures were collected and centrifuged at 10,000 × g 
for 10 min to remove bacterial cells. The resulting supernatant was 
subjected to heat treatment at 80 ◦C for 10 min, then diluted fivefold 
with Milli-Q water. An aliquot of 25 μL of the isotopically labeled in­
ternal standard (M2PFOA, 1 ng mL⁻¹) was added to each sample prior to 
LC-MS/MS analysis. PFOA concentrations were analyzed using a highperformance liquid chromatography system coupled with a tandem 
mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS), following the method described by 
[40]. Chromatographic separation was carried out on a HyperSil GOLD 
C18 column (Thermo Scientific; 2.1 × 100 mm, 3 μm particle size) 
maintained at 40 ◦C. The mobile phase consisted of (A) 1 mM ammo­
nium acetate in water and (B) methanol, delivered at a flow rate of 
0.3 mL min⁻¹ under the following gradient: 20 % B (0–0.5 min), ramped 
to 95 % B (7–10 min), and re-equilibrated to 20 % B (10.5–14 min) (see 
Supplementary Table S3.1). A 10 μL injection volume was used via 
autosampler. Mass spectrometric detection was performed in negative 
electrospray ionization mode (ESI⁻) with the following settings: spray 
voltage −4500 V, source temperature 300 ◦C, and nitrogen used as both 
nebulizing and collision gas. Quantification was conducted in multiple 
reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with a dwell time of 100 ms per 
transition. Specific MRM transitions and parameters for PFOA and 
M2PFOA are provided in Supplementary Table S3.2. PFOA concentra­
tions were calculated by comparing the peak areas of the samples to a 
calibration curve generated from serial dilutions of reference standards. 
Results were corrected for analytical recovery using the internal stan­
dard (M2PFOA). Analyses were performed on biological triplicates, with 
one technical replicate per sample.
2.7. NMR Analysis of PFOA transformation products
¹ ⁹F and ¹H NMR spectroscopy were employed to monitor changes in 
PFOA structure and detect potential transformation products. All ex­
periments were performed on a Varian Inova 500 MHz NMR spec­
trometer, equipped with a QCI HFCN helium cryoprobe, SampleJet 
autosampler, and ATMA autotune system, controlled by MestReNova 
9.0.1 software. ¹ ⁹F spectra were acquired using the zgfhigqn.2 pulse 
sequence (1D ¹⁹F with inverse-gated ¹H decoupling). A broad spectral 
window (-80 to −130 ppm) was used to capture potential signals from 
fluorinated degradation products beyond the parent PFOA (-CF₃ reso­
nance ≈−81.5 ppm). Key acquisition parameters included: acquisition 
time = 500 ms, relaxation delay = 3 s, calibrated 90◦pulse ≈11 μs, and 
enough transients (typically 400–1096) to ensure detection sensitivity. 
The primary goal was to identify new ¹ ⁹F resonances indicative of 
fluorinated metabolites. Complementary ¹H spectra were acquired on 
the same samples using the zgesgp pulse sequence. This aimed to detect 
signals from potential non-fluorinated organic degradation products or 
changes in background signals [5,21].
NMR analysis targeted degradation time points (0 h, 22 h, 45 h, 
93 h, and 165 h) from cultures of OA1 (10⁷ CFU mL⁻¹) grown in MSM 
containing 100 mg L⁻¹ PFOA. Degradation samples were prepared in 
10 % D₂O within 3 mm SampleJet NMR tubes (180–200 μL final vol­
ume). NMR spectra were recorded for biological duplicates, with one 
technical replicate per sample.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Isolation and screening
Three bacterial strains (OA1, OA2, and OA3), exhibiting distinct 
colony morphologies, were isolated from enrichment cultures based on 
their ability to grow on LB and MSM agar plates supplemented with 
PFOA (Figs. 1A and 1B). Their growth in liquid MSM containing 
100 mg L⁻¹ PFOA was monitored over 165 h as shown in Fig. 1C. Among 
the tested isolates, the OA1 strain demonstrated the highest resistance to 
PFOA, as evidenced by a steady increase in optical density (OD₆₀₀) 
during the incubation period. The OD₆₀₀ of OA1 peaked at ~0.4 after 
45 h and remained stable through 165 h, indicating sustained growth 
under high PFOA levels. In contrast, OA2 and OA3 exhibited a decline in 
OD₆₀₀ beyond 45 h, suggesting a lower tolerance to PFOA (Fig. 1C). Our 
results confirmed that only the OA1 strain was capable not only of 
surviving but also of actively growing under PFOA-induced stress, 
highlighting its potential for degradation even under strict nutrient 
conditions. These findings position OA1 as a strong candidate for further 
test for identification and bioremediation of PFOA.
Earlier studies have demonstrated that PFOA can negatively affect 
bacterial cells, even at low concentrations. It can damage cell mem­
branes, cause oxidative stress, and interfere with DNA function, which 
impact cell growth and survival [6,16]. For instance, Pseudomonas aer­
uginosa exposed to just 0.1 mg L⁻¹ PFOA showed a 16 % decrease in 
N. Tellili et al.

optical density (OD₆₀₀) within the first two hours. Although this inhibi­
tion dropped to 5 % after 24 h, the initial response highlights the stress 
PFOA can cause before adaptation begins [9]. In contrast, strain OA1 
demonstrated remarkable tolerance to PFOA exposure with minimal 
signs of initial inhibition even at a much higher PFOA concentration 
(100 mg L⁻¹). OA1 maintained steady growth over a 165-hour period, 
pointing to an unusually high tolerance level and suggesting that this 
strain possesses intrinsic resistance mechanisms. Similar trends were 
observed in a recent study by [47], where the presence of PFOA in 
drinking water systems was associated with increased growth of certain 
bacterial communities, such as Hyphomicrobium, Bradyrhizobium, and 
Microbacterium. Similarly, long-term PFAS exposure in soil has been 
shown to shift microbial community structure and enrich PFAS-tolerant 
taxa such as Proteobacteria, Burkholderiales, and Rhodocyclales [50]. 
These findings highlight that while PFOA is often considered broadly 
toxic, some bacteria can not only tolerate it but may even thrive in its 
presence. OA1 appears to belong to this emerging group of 
PFAS-tolerant strains.
3.2. Identification of selected strain
The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of strain OA1 revealed 
99.77 % sequence identity to Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila. 
Furthermore, BLAST analysis showed that OA1 shares 100 % sequence 
similarity with Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila strain YFMCD4.4, 
indicating a potential close taxonomic relationship or possible identity 
with this strain. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of OA1 has been deposited 
in the NCBI GenBank database under the accession number PV916235.
The identification of strain OA1 as S. acidaminiphila represents a 
significant extension of the phylogenetic spectrum of known PFOAdegrading bacteria, which has been largely confined to Pseudomonas 
species [38,55]. Notably, Pseudomonas parafulva strain YAB1, isolated 
from soil proximal to a fluorochemical production site, demonstrated a 
PFOA degradation efficiency of 32.4 % under optimal laboratory con­
ditions (30◦C, pH 7, 2 % inoculum, 500 mg L⁻¹ initial concentration) 
within 96 h [52]. Similarly, Pseudomonas mosselii strain 5, isolated from 
pesticide-contaminated soil, achieved complete degradation of 
1 mg L⁻¹ PFOA over 7 days under aerobic conditions at 28 ◦C [7]. Other 
species within the genus, including Pseudomonas putida and Pseudo­
monas aeruginosa, have displayed concentration-dependent PFOA 
removal efficiencies [9]. Beyond Pseudomonas, Acidimicrobium sp. strain 
A6 has been implicated in PFOA biodegradation (63 %) at 0.1 mg L⁻¹ , in 
100 days of incubation under anaerobic conditions [12,13,14].
In contrast to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have 
reported the isolation of Stenotrophomonas strains capable of degrading 
PFOA. For instance, [11] identified Stenotrophomonas as the dominant 
bacterial genus in sediments downstream of a PFAS contamination 
source, representing 99.2 % relative abundance, with a strong positive 
correlation to PFAS concentration. These findings suggest that members 
of this genus are not only highly tolerant of PFAS but may also possess 
metabolic capabilities to thrive in such environments. However, no 
direct evidence has previously linked Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila to 
active PFOA biotransformation. The identification of OA1 as a 
PFOA-degrading S. acidaminiphila strain thus provides the first empirical 
confirmation of its functional involvement in PFOA degradation. This 
discovery expands the currently narrow taxonomic scope of documented 
PFOA degraders and highlights Stenotrophomonas as a previously un­
recognized genus with PFOA bioremediation potential. The phyloge­
netic distinction of S. acidaminiphila from established Pseudomonas 
degraders also suggests the presence of unique metabolic pathways, 
providing new perspectives on the microbial mechanisms underlying 
PFAS degradation.
Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila is known for its ability to degrade a 
wide range of environmental pollutants, making it a relevant candidate 
for bioremediation applications [19]. Notably, it has demonstrated the 
ability to metabolize persistent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
(PAHs) such as phenanthrene, pyrene [23]. It has also been identified as 
part of a bacterial consortium capable of breaking down benzopyrene, a 
particularly potent carcinogen [1,2].
In addition to hydrocarbons, this species can degrade pesticides like 
fipronil and chlorothalonil [43,54]. Furthermore, this bacterium has 
shown activity against biologically derived toxins. It degrades micro­
cystins produced during cyanobacterial blooms [51], as well as aflatoxin 
B1, a potent mycotoxin contaminating food crops [41]. This metabolic 
versatility highlights the potential of S. acidaminiphila as a promising 
candidate for mitigating both chemically and biologically contaminated 
environments.
3.3. PFOA Biodegradation using monoculture and consortium
The PFOA degradation efficiency of a bacterial consortium composed 
of three individual strains (OA1, OA2, and OA3) and their respective 
monocultures over a 20-day incubation period is shown in Fig. 2. All 
strains were tested under identical conditions, with an initial PFOA 
concentration of 0.5 mg L⁻¹ in LB medium and bacterial concentrations

S. acidaminiphila OA1 exhibited the greatest reduction in PFOA con­
centration by day 20, achieving a 20 % decrease (higher than that 
observed for OA2, OA3 and even the bacterial consortium). Statistical 
analysis indicated no significant difference between S. acidaminiphila 
OA1 and the consortium (p = 0.187). However, S. acidaminiphila OA1 
was significantly more effective than OA2 and OA3 (p < 0.001). The 
difference in biodegradation capacity between OA2 and OA3 was min­
imal and not statistically significant (p = 0.997). Although the con­
sortium demonstrated moderate performance, it did not surpass 
S. acidaminiphila OA1, suggesting that combining the strains did not 
enhance degradation efficiency (Fig. 2). These results indicate that 
S. acidaminiphila OA1 is the primary contributor to PFOA degradation, 
even within the consortium. The absence of inhibitory interactions 
during isolation initially led to the hypothesis of a potential synergistic 
effect; however, the data suggest that S. acidaminiphila OA1 alone ac­
counts for most of the observed biodegradation activity. These findings 
align with and diverge from trends reported in previous research. Pre­
vious studies have highlighted the potential advantages of microbial 
consortia for the biodegradation of persistent pollutants, including 
perfluorinated compounds, due to their metabolic diversity and resil­
ience to environmental fluctuations (Liang et al., 2024; [46]). For 
example, Liang et al. (2024) showed that consortia predominantly 
comprised of Hyphomicrobium species (46.7 %) along with unclassified 
microorganisms (53.0 %) achieve higher removal rates of PFOS 
compared to single strains, with some studies reporting up to 56.7 % 
reduction over 20 days under optimized conditions with auxiliary sub­
strates [22]. The rationale is that consortia can compensate for the 
metabolic limitations of individual strains, allowing for more complete 
or robust degradation pathways.
However, the present results indicate that, at least for the tested 
strains and conditions, the consortium did not enhance PFOA degrada­
tion beyond what was achieved by the most effective single strain (OA1). 
This outcome suggests that the additional strains in the consortium may 
not have contributed complementary metabolic functions necessary for 
further degradation, or that potential interspecies interactions did not 
facilitate a cooperative effect. Similar observations have been noted in 
recent studies, where the effectiveness of consortia can fluctuate 
depending on community composition, stability, and the presence of key 
degraders [46]. In some cases, the degradation activity of consortia is 
driven largely by a dominant strain, with other members providing 
limited or even inhibitory effects (Liang et al., 2024).
These findings stand in contrast to the study by Tang et al. [42], 
where a native microbial consortium derived from PFAS-contaminated 
aquifer solids achieved a 13.52 % biological removal efficiency of 
PFOA after a 10-month incubation period under anoxic conditions. In 
their case, the microbial community was complex and enriched with 
low-abundance taxa such as Flexilinea flocculi, Bacteriovorax stolpii, and 
Sphingomonas, which were correlated with fluoride ion generation 
indicating active defluorination processes. Interestingly, although 
defluorination was confirmed, the overall removal efficiency was rela­
tively low, possibly due to the slow metabolism and low growth rate of 
anaerobic communities [42].
3.4. Batch and Fed-Batch biodegradation of PFOA by S. acidaminiphila 
OA1
Batch and fed-batch experiments were conducted to assess the effect 
of initial cell density (10⁷ to 10 ¹⁰ CFU mL⁻¹) and nutrient addition (10 % 
LB from day 7) on PFOA degradation by S. acidaminiphila OA1. For all 
degradation assays, actively growing OA1 cells harvested at midexponential phase were transferred into fresh LB medium supple­
mented with 0.5 mg⋅L⁻¹ PFOA.
As shown in Fig. 3A, all tested cell densities exhibited progressive 
PFOA removal over the 30-day incubation period. Statistical analysis 
confirmed that while time was a highly significant factor (p < 0.001), 
the starting bacterial concentration did not significantly affect the final 
degradation efficiency across a 1,000-fold inoculum range (p = 0.596, 
two-way ANOVA; no significant pairwise differences by Tukey’s test, 
p > 0.05). By day 30, PFOA removal efficiencies reached 42.0 % (10⁷ 
CFU mL⁻¹), 43.7 % (10⁸), 42.0 % (10⁹), and 45.3 % (10 ¹⁰) (Fig. 3A). 
Linear regression confirmed a consistent, time-dependent degradation 
pattern across all densities (Table 1), with the steepest slope (a = 1.525) 
observed at the highest tested concentration (10 ¹⁰ CFU mL⁻¹).
As illustrated in Fig. 3B, all fed-batch operations resulted in lower 
degradation efficiencies than batch operations by day 30 across all 
bacterial concentrations: 29.2 % vs. 42.0 % for 10⁷, 32.1 % vs. 43.7 % 
for 10⁸, 27.4 % vs. 42.0 % for 10⁹, and 31.3 % vs. 45.3 % for 10 ¹ ⁰. 
Linear regression further confirmed that the degradation rate was 
28.5 % lower in fed-batch mode, with a steeper slope (1.080, R² = 0.964, 
p = 0.018) compared to batch (slope = 1.510, R² = 0.992, p = 0.004) at 
10⁸ CFU mL⁻¹ (Table 1).
Our findings notably deviate from the established understanding that 
biodegradation efficiency depends strongly on active biomass, where 
higher cell densities typically enhance pollutant removal. This principle

is evident in most microbial PFOA degradation studies, including the 
study on strain YAB1, where increasing the inoculum from 1 % to 2 % 
boosted PFOA degradation; however, higher inocula (>2 %) caused 
growth inhibition due to nutrient limitation [52]. Similarly, Chiriac 
et al. [9] reported that P. putida achieved a 19 % reduction in PFOA 
concentration over a 96-hour incubation period. Although the authors 
did not explicitly provide the cell count used, they did mention that 
bacterial strain with an optical density of 0.2 at 600 nm was used in the 
experiments, suggesting that degradation rates were linked to the 
number of active cells [9]. Unlike these strains, S. acidaminiphila OA1 
showed a degradation pattern that was primarily time-dependent and 
unaffected by initial cell density, pointing to a distinct metabolic 
strategy.
In comparison with batch mode, fed-batch conditions resulted in 
lower final degradation efficiency and slower degradation kinetics. The 
addition of LB likely caused a metabolic shift away from PFOA meta­
bolism, a dilution effect, and potentially disrupted the catabolic balance, 
reducing both viability and degradation efficiency. This interpretation is 
supported by viable cell counts at day 30, showing 15 % reduced 
viability in fed-batch (8.5 × 10⁸ CFU mL⁻¹) compared to batch (10⁹ CFU 
mL⁻¹) at equivalent starting concentrations of 10⁹ CFU mL⁻¹ . The 
reduced degradation efficiency under fed-batch conditions indicates 
that S. acidaminiphila OA1 preferentially metabolizes the simpler nu­
trients present in LB medium over PFOA. This preference aligns with 
observations in activated sludge systems where PFAS removal is often 
dominated by adsorption, with biodegradation being minor or inhibited 
[8], and where PFAS presence can severely disrupt nutrient removal 
performance and microbial ecology [17]. Therefore, while conventional 
bioreactor design emphasizes maintaining high active biomass through 
nutrient management, our findings with S. acidaminiphila OA1 suggest 
that such strategies could be counterproductive for PFOA degradation 
by this specific strain, as supplemental nutrients divert metabolic ac­
tivity away from the target pollutant.
Table 2 provides an overview of reported PFOA biodegradation 
performances by different bacterial strains, summarizing tested con­
centrations, degradation efficiencies, experimental conditions, and 
literature sources. This comparison places the results obtained with 
S. acidaminiphila OA1 into a broader context, highlighting its relative 
efficiency under similar or varying conditions. Despite these promising 
performances, microbial approaches to PFAS degradation still present 
several limitations. The stability of the carbon–fluorine bond makes 
microbial breakdown inherently difficult, and only a few microorgan­
isms have evolved the capacity to attack these compounds. As a result, 
degradation is often slow and incomplete, leading to the accumulation 
of intermediate products such as shorter-chain PFAS, and the release of 
inorganic fluoride can further inhibit microbial activity. Moreover, mi­
crobial performance is strongly influenced by environmental variables 
such as pH, temperature, and co-contaminants, and most published 
studies remain restricted to laboratory conditions, with limited evidence 
at pilot or field scale [28]. These limitations highlight the need for 
continued optimization and, potentially, integration of microbial 
strategies with complementary remediation technologies.
3.5. Investigation on possible PFOA transformation products
As S. acidaminiphila OA1 strain exhibited a progressive reduction in 
PFOA concentration over time, a survey on possible metabolites was 
performed using ¹H and ¹ ⁹F NMR spectroscopy. NMR analysis targeted 
selected degradation time points (0 h, 22 h, 45 h, 93 h, and 165 h) from 
S. acidaminiphila OA1 cultures grown under stress conditions, in MSM 
supplemented with 100 mg L⁻¹ PFOA. Although this condition did not 
correspond to the most pronounced degradation observed across all 
trials, it was chosen to assess whether any detectable transformation 
could occur under extreme exposure. The goal was to capture potential 
early-stage metabolites or structural changes within a short timeframe, 
even before significant overall degradation had occurred.
¹H 1D NMR spectra revealed multiple novel signals that were absent 
in the non-inoculated control sample (Fig. 4A and B). Given that native 
PFOA is fully fluorinated and contains no hydrogen atoms on its carbon 
backbone, these signals provide clear evidence of PFOA biotransfor­
mation by strain OA1. The most informative signals appeared in the 
downfield region between 3.0 and 3.8 ppm (Fig. 4A). This area con­
tained a series of multiplets, particularly between 3.4 and 3.8 ppm, 
which are characteristic of protons on a carbon adjacent to carboxylic 
group or one or more strongly electronegative atoms, such as fluorine. 
Likely structures would include –CH₂–COOH, –CH₂–CF₂–. This obser­
vation strongly suggests the introduction of hydrogen onto the PFOA 
backbone via hydrodefluorination specifically at the α-carbon, a chem­
ically reactive site. Hydrodefluorination is a plausible pathway that 
would yield a product like COOH−CH2−(CF2)6−CF3, whose α-methy­
lene protons would resonate in the observed range. The absence of new 
signals in the typical aliphatic region (1.2–1.4 ppm) argues against 
extensive defluorination or the formation of long hydrocarbon chains. 
Further analysis of the ¹H spectrum revealed a sharp singlet at 8.35 ppm, 
a hallmark of a proton in a highly deshielded environment (Fig. 4B).

Such downfield shift with singlet multiplicity is likely attributable to a 
small, oxidized formyl group (–CHO) metabolites such as formic acid 
(HCOOH), suggesting that oxidative chain scission is another key 
transformation pathway. Additionally, three distinct singlets between 
3.1 and 3.4 ppm (Fig. 4A) point to the formation of small, nonfluorinated breakdown products. Their singlet multiplicity excludes 
coupling to adjacent fluorine, suggesting structures like methyl esters 
(−O−CH3) or short-chain alcohols.
Complementary ¹ ⁹F NMR analysis showed no significant changes in 
the fluorine signals of PFOA over the incubation period (Fig. 4C). The 
absence of additional ¹ ⁹F signals does not exclude transformation but 
implies that only a limited number of fluorinated positions were 
affected, or that fluorinated intermediates remain below the detection 
threshold of the current NMR acquisition settings. This finding, when 
paired with the ¹H NMR data, supports a model of localized, rather than 
global, transformation. The perfluorinated carbon skeleton of the bulk 
PFOA remains largely intact, with modifications confined to specific, 
reactive sites.
Notably, the chemical shifts of all ¹H signals were consistently 
detected across all time points (22–165 h), indicating the steady accu­
mulation of stable transformation products. This consistency implies 
that the observed metabolites result from selective, enzyme-driven 
mechanisms rather than random chemical degradation. Taken 
together, the NMR evidence points to a clear model of early-stage PFOA 
biotransformation by S. acidaminiphila OA1, involving targeted hydro­
defluorination at reactive carbons and subsequent oxidative cleavage. 
However, complementary detection systems and more experiments are 
needed, to further validate the exact chemical identity of the metabolites 
and their toxicity.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply NMR spectroscopy 
for capturing early-stage structural changes in PFOA during bacterial 
transformation. Previous research has used ¹ ⁹F NMR to trace fluo­
rophenol degradation by Rhodococcus ssp. Bondar et al., [4]. Both 
Chiriac et al. [9] and Huang et al. (2019) reported the sequential 
shortening of the perfluoroalkyl chain in PFOA, identifying in­
termediates such as PFHpA, PFHxA, and PFPeA using LC-MS analysis 
([9]; Huang et al., 2019). Our approach provides a complementary 
method that captures a more immediate picture of the transformation 
process. Although definitive intermediates were not resolved in this 
instance, our work establishes a methodological proof-of-concept for 
using NMR to gain direct structural insights into the initial steps of 
long-chain PFAS biodegradation, while also highlighting the current 
limitation of not assessing overall mineralization.
4. Conclusion
This study demonstrated the successful isolation and characteriza­
tion of a high-performing PFOA-degrading bacterium, strain OA1, 
identified as Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila, from a petroleumcontaminated soil environment. S. acidaminiphila OA1 demonstrated 
consistent and efficient PFOA degradation under batch conditions, 
reaching up to 45 % removal in 30 days, a performance superior to both 
other isolates and consortium. Interestingly, degradation efficiency was 
not significantly affected by inoculum size across a 1,000-fold range, 
challenging common assumptions that higher biomass enhances 
biodegradation. In contrast to many PFAS biodegradation strategies that 
rely on maximizing active cell densities, S. acidaminiphila OA1 main­
tained its activity regardless of cell concentration, suggesting an alter­
native degradation mechanism. Nutrient supplementation in fed-batch 
mode further revealed that additional of extra organic matter may 
disrupt degradation performance, likely due to metabolic prioritization 
or dilution effects. To deepen our understanding of this process, ¹H and 
¹ ⁹F NMR spectroscopy was employed to investigate early-stage trans­
formation products. To our knowledge, this is the first application of 
NMR to specifically track structural changes in PFOA during bacterial 
transformation. Overall, the findings highlight S. acidaminiphila OA1’s 
potential as a robust candidate for potential scalable bioremediation 
applications targeting persistent contaminants like PFOA. Although 
promising, future evaluations of biodegradation performance in real 
water matrices such as groundwater, surface water, or industrial 
wastewater are still needed to fully assess the performance of this newly 
isolated strain.
Environmental Implication
This study demonstrates, for the first time, the ability of Steno­
trophomonas acidaminiphila OA1 to biotransform perfluorooctanoic acid 
(PFOA), a persistent and toxic PFAS compound, under environmentally 
relevant conditions. The strain maintained growth at realistic contami­
nation levels and achieved up to 45 % degradation over 30 days without 
nutrient supplementation. NMR analysis revealed selective backbone 
modifications, suggesting a targeted degradation mechanism. These 
findings highlight OA1’s potential as a robust candidate for sustainable 
bioremediation of fluorinated contaminants, offering a low-cost and 
biologically viable alternative to current energy-intensive PFOA treat­
ment technologies.
