ABSTRACT: Incubations with pure and enrichment cultures
of Acidimicrobium sp. strain A6 (A6), an autotroph that
oxidizes ammonium to nitrite while reducing ferric iron, were
conducted in the presence of PFOA or PFOS at 0.1 mg/L and
100 mg/L. Buildup of ﬂuoride, shorter-chain perﬂuorinated
products, and acetate was observed, as well as a decrease in
Fe(III) reduced per ammonium oxidized. Incubations with
hydrogen as a sole electron donor also resulted in the
deﬂuorination of these PFAS. Removal of up to 60% of PFOA
and PFOS was observed during 100 day incubations, while
total ﬂuorine (organic plus ﬂuoride) remained constant
throughout the incubations. To determine if PFOA/PFOS
or some of their degradation products were metabolized, and
since no organic carbon source except these PFAS was added, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was tracked. At concentrations
of 100 mg/L, PFOA/PFOS were the main contributors to DOC, which remained constant during the pure A6 culture
incubations. Whereas in the A6 enrichment culture, DOC decreased slightly with time, indicating that as deﬂuorination of
PFOS/PFOA occurred, some of the products were being metabolized by heterotrophs present in this culture. Results show that
A6 can deﬂuorinate PFOA/PFOS while reducing iron, using ammonium or hydrogen as the electron donor.
■INTRODUCTION
PFAS (per- and polyﬂuoroalkyl substances) are known to be
among the most challenging organic pollutants to remediate in
aquatic and terrestrial environments.1 PFAS are found in a
wide range of consumer products, they are ubiquitous in the
environment, and are extremely recalcitrant. Among them,
perﬂuorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perﬂuorooctane sulfonate
(PFOS), which have been manufactured widely and can also
be formed via degradation of precursors, are the most common
PFAS present in many environmental settings and are of
increasing concern.2,3 Studies indicate that PFOA and PFOS
pose considerable threats to the natural environment and
human health because of their wide distribution, extraordinary
persistence, bioaccumulation tendencies, and potential toxicological eﬀects.4−7 Therefore, identifying methods to mineralize
these PFAS is a topic of growing urgency.
The carbon−ﬂuorine (C−F) bond is the strongest covalent
bond in organic chemistry,8 hence biodegradation of
perﬂuoroalkyl chemicals is diﬃcult and usually limited to
molecules, or regions of molecules, that are not fully
ﬂuorinated3 such as ﬂuorobenzene,9 ﬂuoroacetate,10 perﬂuorohexylethanol,11,12 and perﬂuorohexylsulfonate.13 Fluorotelomer compounds, which have an ethyl group between the
perﬂuoroalkyl chain and the rest of the nonﬂuorinated
functional groups, can undergo extensive transformations,
resulting in a partial deﬂuorination or shortening of the
perﬂuoroalkyl chain.14 These ﬁndings on ﬂuorotelomer
transformation are consistent with those on degradations of
diﬂuoromethane sulfonate (DFMS) and 2,2,2-triﬂuoroethane
sulfonate (TES), all of which contain C−H bonds,15 indicating
that the lack of C−H bonds in perﬂuorinated compounds like
PFOA and PFOS makes them more diﬀcult to degrade.
Studies of successful PFOA and PFOS biodegradation,
especially mineralization, are limited. It has been reported that
PFOS and PFOA can be eliminated using activated sludge as a
seed and incubated under anaerobic conditions, although the
buildup of ﬂuoride ion (F−) was not observed.16,17 In studies
by single cultures, a decrease of about 32% of PFOA was
observed after a 96 h incubation with Pseudomonas parafulva,18
and 67% of PFOS was biologically decomposed by
Pseudomonas aeruginosa over 48 h.19 The degradation of
PFOS by Pseudomonas plecoglossicida was studied, which
showed that this strain can use PFOS as a carbon source,
transforming it to perﬂuoroheptanoic acid and releasing F−.20
Although reductive deﬂuorination has been shown to be
energetically favorable,1 up to date, no bioreductive deﬂuorination of perﬂuorinated compounds such as PFOA and PFOS
has been reported in the literature.

Anaerobic oxidation of ammonium (NH4
+) under ironreducing conditions, referred to as Feammox, is a relatively
novel pathway in the nitrogen cycle. Here, NH4
+ is oxidized to
nitrite (NO2
−) coupled to the reduction of ferric iron [Fe(III)]
to ferrous iron [Fe(II)].21 An autotrophic microorganism
responsible for this process, Acidimicrobium sp. strain A6
(ATCC, PTA-122488; referred to as A6 from here on), has
been identiﬁed21 and isolated.22 The environmental conditions
at sites where the Feammox process occurs and A6 is present
have been described and show that the organism is common at
sites where the pH is <7 and soils are iron rich.23 The
Feammox process has been reported to occur by many
investigators in many diﬀerent environmental settings.24−28

source can be written as:21

For this reaction and environmental/incubation conditions
described previously,21 the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔGr)
is 145.08 kJ/mol NH4
+. Although oxidation of NH4
+ to N2 has
been reported for the Feammox process,25 incubations with A6
have shown that NO2
−is the product of the NH4
+ oxidation by
this organism.21,22 It was also shown that in addition to NH4
+,
A6 is capable of using H2 as an electron donor while reducing
Fe(III).22 Furthermore, it was shown that A6 is unable to
utilize common organic electron donors as its carbon source,
but that it does incorporate CO2 into its biomass.22 Given that
it has been shown that A6 can cometabolically degrade TCE
and PCE,29 the objective of this research was to determine if
PFAS, speciﬁcally PFOA and PFOS, can be biodegraded/
deﬂuorinated by either the pure A6 and/or an A6 enrichment
culture while oxidizing NH4
+ or H2 under iron-reducing
conditions.
■MATERIALS AND METHODS
Feammox Incubation Experiments. Two hundred
milliliters of either a pure A6 culture22 or an A6 enrichment
culture, obtained from a Feammox laboratory-scale continuous-ﬂow membrane reactor,21 which has been operated for 180
days, were mixed with 500 mL of an anoxic inorganic Fe(III)−
NH4
+ enrichment medium.22 This medium consisted of 7.5
mM 6-line ferrihydrite (Fe2O3·0.5H2O, prepared according to
Cornell and Schwertmann30), 2.81 mM NH4Cl, 0.19 mM
(NH4)2SO4, 0.24 mM NaHCO3, 0.71 mM KHCO3, 0.07 mM
KH2PO4, 0.41 mM MgSO4·7H2O, and 0.40 mM CaCl2·2H2O,
in addition to 1 mL/L of a trace element solution31 and 1 mL/
L of a vitamin solution (ATCC MD-VS). The mixture of
medium and culture was then shaken in an anaerobic chamber
for 24 h to be homogenized prior to the incubations. An
electron shuttling compound, 9,10-anthraquinone-2,7-disulphonic acid (AQDS), was added to the pure A6 culture at 25
μM, which was shown to be needed to grow the pure A6
culture.22 These mixtures were evenly distributed into multiple
10 mL serum vials in an anaerobic chamber and were sealed
with butyl rubber stoppers. The headspace (2 mL) of each vial
was vacuumed and then ﬂushed with a N2/CO2 (80:20)
mixture to achieve anoxic conditions and provide additional
CO2 to the vials, which is required by A6 for its growth. All
steps for the inoculation and isolation were carried out under
sterilized conditions (autoclaved vials, and the media ﬁltered
through a 0.2 μm membrane). The Eh in the vials was −135 ±
17 mV, and the initial pH was 4.5 ± 0.2 and increased to 5.0 ±
0.2 during the incubations.
Eﬀects of PFOA and PFOS on the growth of A6 and its
Feammox activity were evaluated via incubations at initial
concentrations of 0.24 μM, 2.4 μM, 0.024 mM, and 0.24 mM
PFOA and 0.20 μM, 2.0 μM, 0.02 mM, and 0.20 mM PFOS
(equivalent to 0.1 mg/L, 1.0 mg/L, 10 mg/L, 100 mg/L, and
200 mg/L PFOA/PFOS).
PFOA and PFOS Incubations with NH4
+ as Electron
Donor. Incubations as described above were conducted with
initial concentrations of both 0.24 μM and 0.24 mM (0.1 mg/
L and 100 mg/L) PFOA as well as 0.20 μM and 0.20 mM (0.1
mg/L and 100 mg/L) PFOS. The high concentration (0.24
mM PFOA and 0.20 mM PFOS), much higher than what is
most often found in contaminated environments, was selected
to allow for more accurate F−and sulfate (SO4
2−) analyses,
ﬂuorine and carbon balance, and to evaluate the eﬀect of
deﬂuorination on the reduction of Fe(III). For each set of
experiments, several controls were prepared, including a
positive control that was identical as described above but
without PFAS to compare the Feammox activity in their
absence. One set was prepared as described above with the
PFAS and was autoclaved. One set was prepared as above with
the PFAS and no NH4
+ to link the PFAS degradation to
Feammox activity (or lack thereof in the absence of NH4
+).
One set was prepared as described above but without adding a
Fe(III) source. Finally, one set was prepared with the PFAS,
but instead of seeding the vials with A6, they were seeded with
Geobacter sulfurreducens ATCC 51573 (with an initial
concentration of 0.12 × 107 copies/mL) and augmented
with 0.5 mM acetate to determine if the iron reduction and
buildup of Fe(II) might be responsible for the degradation of
these PFAS. All vials were placed on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm
at 30 °C for the incubations. On days 0, 7, 35, 60, and 100,
three vials were destructively sampled for Fe(II), NH4
+,
PFOA/PFOS, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and microbial
analyses. An additional three vials were sacriﬁced, ﬁltered, and
stored at 4 °C to be available if required for further analyses.
Given the large time interval between analyzing the data
collected on day 60 and day 100, and since data from day 100
are key to assess how much a chemical constituent has changed
during the incubations, samples from three stored vials
collected on day 60 were analyzed for all compounds measured
at the same time as the 100 day samples to ascertain that the
accuracy of the various analytical techniques had not changed
over time. Hence, n = 6 for day 60.
PFOA and PFOS Incubations with H2 as Electron
Donor. Hydrogen (H2) was tested as an alternate electron
donor to NH4
+ for A6 to conduct PFAS degradation/
deﬂuorination. For this purpose, pure A6 and A6 enrichment
cultures were incubated with the same medium plus PFAS, but
without NH4
+, and with H2 in the headspace of the vials. A
small amount of NH4
+ (0.15−0.20 mM) was still present in the
vials to which no NH4
+ was added, which originated from the
transfer of cells from the inoculum and was the nitrogen source
required for bacterial growth in these incubations. Five
incubation sets were conducted in parallel for both the pure
A6 and the A6 enrichment cultures including (1) PFOA/
PFOS + Fe(III) + NH4
+, (2) PFOA/PFOS + Fe(III) + H2, (3)
PFOA/PFOS + H2, (4) PFOA/PFOS + Fe(III) + NH4
+ + H2,
and (5) autoclaved control of PFOA/PFOS + Fe(III) + H2.
With the exception of the samples to which no NH4
+ was
added, the concentrations of PFOA/PFOS, Fe(III), and NH4
+

were the same as for the experiments with NH4
+ as electron
donor. The incubations with NH4
+ instead of H2 as electron
donor were run in parallel to compare the eﬀects of these two
electron donors on the degradation of PFAS, under the exact
same initial culture activity, bacterial numbers, and incubation
conditions.
For each incubation, 2 mL of either a pure A6 or an A6
enrichment culture was mixed with 18 mL of the medium
including 0.24 mM PFOA or 0.20 mM PFOS in a 50 mL vial.
The headspace of each vial was vacuumed and then, for the
incubations with H2 as electron donor, was ﬁlled with a N2/H2
(80:20) mixture, while for those with NH4
+ as electron donor
vials were ﬁlled with a N2/CO2 mixture (80:20). Vials were
then placed on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm at 30 °C for a 35 day
incubation period. Three subsamples were collected destrucFigure 1. Results of PFOA 0.24 mM (100 mg/L) incubations with pure A6 and A6 enrichment cultures and NH4

Chemical and Microbiological Analyses. PFAS were
analyzed commercially by the Guangdong Institute of
Microbiology (China) and Euroﬁns (USA) via ultraperformance liquid chromatography−tandem mass spectrometry
(UPLC-MS−MS: Agilent 1290-6430A) following well-established methods.32,33 All compounds were quantiﬁed with a
standard curve in the range of 0.5−100 μg/L, after making
appropriate dilutions with methanol. A blank control was also
included in each sample sequence to ascertain that the target
compounds were not detected in their absence. A Zorbax SBC18 (10 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) column was used at 50 °C,
with an isocratic mobile phase composed of (A) (32:0.15% (v/
v) acetic acid in water) and (B) (68:0.15% (v/v) acetic acid in
methanol) with a ﬂow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The eluent gradient
started with 25% (B) for 0.5 min, and then was lineally
increased to 95% (B) in 6 mins and held at that gradient for 5
min, and eventually returned to the initial conditions within 1
min and held for 2 mins for equilibration during the injection
interval. Detection was done by negative electrospray
ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry in a multiple reaction
monitoring mode (MRM) (more detailed information is
provided in Section S1.1 and Table S1 of the Supporting
Information).
Redox potential and pH in the incubation vials were
measured using a Hach HQ40d multi-probe meter (Hach,
Loveland, CO, USA). DOC and POC (particulate organic
carbon) were analyzed using a Shimadzu TOC-5000A analyzer
for samples ﬁltered through or retained by 0.2 μm aperture
ﬁlters.21,34 Fe(II) was analyzed via the ferrozine assay
method.35 Diﬀerent ions were analyzed for ﬁltered samples
(0.2 μm) via an ion chromatograph (IC) with a conductivity
detector (ICS-3000, Dionex Co., USA), with an AS18 column
(4 mm i.d. × 200 mm) for anions and a CS16 column (4 mm
i.d. × 200 mm) for cations.21,23
Since precise F−analyses are key in this research, and since
they can be aﬀected by various interferences, multiple QA
precautions were taken. The analytical method for F−was
modiﬁed based on methodologies described in the literature.36,37 Two separate IC analyses were conducted. The ﬁrst
one used an AS-18 column with a KOH solution (20 mM) as
the eluent, ﬂow rate = 0.80 mL min−1, and the suppressor
current was set at 85 mA. The other one used an AS12A
column (4 mm i.d. × 200 mm), with 7.5 mM NaHCO3/22.5
mM Na2CO3 as the eluent, ﬂow rate = 1.00 mL min−1, and the
suppressor current was set at 50 mA. Dionex retention time
standards were used as external calibration curves, which
contained F−at seven equal-increment dilutions up to a
concentration of 5.2 mM. There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence
(p < 0.05) in the measured F−concentration between IC
methods, hence the values reported here for all incubations
with the higher PFAS concentrations, and used for the ﬂuoride
balances, are for the AS-18 column with KOH as the eluent.
Retention times and the chromatograms of the analysis of F−
and other ions are shown in Table S2. As an additional
conﬁrmation, F−was also analyzed using a perfectION
combination electrode (Mettler-Toledo, USA). The concentrations measured with the F−-speciﬁc electrode were within
10% of those measured via IC and were not signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent (p < 0.05). F−measurements for the lowconcentration PFAS incubations were somewhat higher using
the electrode, and the diﬀerence between the IC and the
electrode measurements was signiﬁcant.
Total DNA was extracted from samples of the 100 day
incubations with 0.24 mM PFOA and 0.20 mM PFOS
(Section S1.2, Supporting Information). Sequencing of the 16S
rRNA genes from the A6 enrichment cultures over the
incubation period was performed on an Illumina MiSeq
platform (Section S1.3, Supporting Information). The 16S
rRNA genes of A6 were quantiﬁed through quantitative PCR
(qPCR) analyses (Section S1.4, Supporting Information).21,23
Statistical Analysis. The normality and homoscedasticity
of the data was examined. Signiﬁcance for all tests was
accepted at the 0.05 level. All the analyses were performed
using SPSS v12.
■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Degradation of PFOA with NH4
+ as Electron Donor.
Eﬀects of PFOA on the Feammox activity (in terms of NH4
+
removed and Fe(III) produced, as well as on A6 numbers)
were found to be negligible within the concentration of interest
over a 2 week incubation and are discussed in Section S2 and
Figure S1 of the Supporting Information. Figure 1 shows
results for incubations with an initial PFOA concentration of
0.24 mM (100 mg/L) for the pure A6 and the A6 enrichment
cultures. Comparable NH4
+ removal, Fe(II) and NO2
−
production, and A6-16S rRNA gene numbers during the
incubations (Figure 1c, d, f and Figure S3a) show that both
cultures had very similar Feammox activity. While all
incubations were set up without adding organic carbon,
buildup of acetate (Figure 1e) was detected in both cultures
during incubations with PFOA, and to higher levels than in the
positive control without PFOA (Figures S4c and S6c).
Over the 100 day incubations, a 0.12 mM (50%) decrease of
PFOA was detected in the A6 enrichment culture and 0.08
mM (33%) in the pure A6 culture (Figure 1a). Four
intermediate products, including perﬂuorobutanoic acid
(HFBA), perﬂuoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), perﬂuorohexanoic
acid (PFHxA), and perﬂuoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) (Figure
1g) were detected in the A6 enrichment culture incubations,
neither of which was present initially nor in any control. Only
perﬂuorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) was detected in the
incubation with the pure A6 culture, and at much lower
concentrations (0.12 ± 0.05 μM) than in the A6 enrichment
culture. After the incubation, 1.36 mM of F−was detected in
the A6 enrichment culture, and 0.42 mM in the pure A6
culture incubations (Figure 1b).
During the same period, the 16S rRNA gene numbers of A6
increased from 1.15 × 106 to 3.57 × 106 copies/mL in the pure
culture and from 0.87 × 106 to 4.02 × 106 copies/mL in the
enrichment culture (Figure 1f).
There were no changes in concentration of any of the
chemical species monitored in the autoclaved controls, and
there was no PFOA removal or F−generation in the cultures
without Fe(III) or NH4
+, nor in the incubations with G.
sulfurreducens (Figures S4 and S6). Over the 100 day
incubations, Geobacter increased from 0.12 × 107 to 2.12 ×
107 copies/mL and produced 6.98 mM Fe(II) (Figure S6).
Results for the incubations with an initial concentration of
0.24 μM (0.1 mg/L) show a 0.15 μM (63%) PFOA removal
for both the pure A6 and the A6 enrichment cultures (Figure
S8). Due to the low concentrations, neither the intermediate
nor end products were analyzed. The higher relative error of
the F−analysis at this concentration and lack of quantiﬁed

intermediates does not allow for an accurate ﬂuorine balance.
Acetate concentrations in the incubations with 0.24 μM PFOA
(Figure S8e) are somewhat higher than those in the positive
control (Figure S4c) but not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent.
Degradation of PFOS with NH4
+ as Electron Donor.
Similar to the results for PFOA, eﬀects of PFOS on Feammox
activity were negligible as discussed in Section S2 and Figure
S2 in the Supporting Information. As shown in Figure 2, 0.045
mM (23%) of PFOS was removed by the pure A6 culture over
100 days of incubation, and 0.093 mM (47%) by the A6
enrichment culture. Intermediates detected in the A6 enrichment culture include HFBA and perﬂuorobutane sulfonate
(PFBS) (Figure 2h), while the only intermediate detected in
the pure A6 culture incubation, and at a much lower
concentration, is PFBS.
As for the incubations with PFOA, comparable NH4
+
oxidation, and Fe(III) and NO2
−production were found in
both cultures during these incubations (Figure 2c, d and Figure
S3b). The number of A6-16S rRNA genes in the pure culture
increased from 0.70 × 106 to 3.32 × 106 copies/mL, and from
Figure 2. Results of PFOS 0.20 mM (100 mg/L) incubations with pure A6 and A6 enrichment cultures and NH4

0.85 × 106 to 3.51 × 106 copies/mL in the enrichment culture
(Figure 2f). The F−measurements show that 1.07 mM of F−
was produced during the 100 day incubation with the A6
enrichment culture, which is almost 10 times higher than the
amount of F−produced in the pure A6 culture incubation
(Figure 2b). An increase of 0.13 mM SO4
2−was observed in
the pure A6 culture during the PFOS incubations (Figure 2g),
which was not observed in the incubations with PFOA.
Autoclaving the medium in the presence of ferrihydrite
resulted in a decrease in the dissolved SO4
2−concentration
as can be seen in Figure 2g. The noisier baseline of the
autoclaved control makes it harder to state conclusively that
there was a signiﬁcant increase in the SO4
2−concentration in
the A6 enrichment culture. Furthermore, the presence of
sulfate reducers (see microbial community discussions below),
decrease in SO4
2−over time in the positive control (Figure
S7g), and coupled to the decrease in DOC vs time in the A6
enrichment culture (see dissolved carbon balance section
below) indicate that sulfate reduction could have occurred in
the A6 enrichment culture incubations, which makes it diﬃcult
to determine if sulfate was produced from the degradation of
PFOS in these incubations.
There were no changes in concentration of any of the
chemical species monitored in the autoclaved controls where
there was no PFOS removal or F−generation in the cultures
without Fe(III) or NH4
+ and neither was there PFOS removal
in the incubations with G. sulfurreducens (Figures S5 and S7).
Over the incubation period, G. sulfurreducens numbers
increased from 0.12 × 107 to 1.98 × 107 copies/mL, producing
6.24 mM Fe(II) (Figure S7).
Results for the incubations with an initial concentration of
0.20 μM (100 μg/L) PFOS shown in Figure S9 show that the
pure A6 culture removed 0.07 μM (35%) PFOS and the A6
enrichment culture removed 0.12 μM (60%) over the
incubation period.
It is interesting to note that, in general, the fraction of
PFOA/PFOS removed by each culture was similar for the
incubations with the high and the low PFOA/PFOS
concentration.
Degradation of PFOA and PFOS with H2 as Electron
Donor. A comparable amount of PFOA removal was observed
during 35 days of incubation in both the pure A6 and the A6
enrichment cultures when either Fe(III) + NH4
+ or Fe(III) +
H2 were present (Figure S10a). Similar results were observed
for the PFOS incubations (Figure S11a). No PFAS removal
was observed in the autoclaved controls (Figures S10a and
S11a), nor in any of the other controls discussed above.
A noticeable increase over time of ﬂuorinated degradation
products (HBFA, PFPeA, PFHxA, and PFHxA for the PFOA
incubations and HBFA and PFBS for the PFOS incubations)
was detected in the A6 enrichment culture incubations
(Figures S10g,h and S11g,h). A buildup of ﬂuorinated
degradation products was not observed in the pure A6 culture
incubations.
Sulfate buildup in the PFOS incubations (Figure S11g) was
signiﬁcant for the pure A6 culture incubations when either
NH4
+ or H2 was the electron acceptor, while for the
enrichment culture the increase in sulfate was only signiﬁcant
when NH4
+ was the electron donor.
Characteristics of the Microbial Community during
Incubations with and without PFOA/PFOS. The microbial
community analysis reveals the presence of denitriﬁers
(Ralstonia and Bacillus),38,39 iron reducers (Acidimicrobium
and Aciditerrimonas),40 and sulfate reducers (Desulfosporosinus).41,42 These organisms might have been using the NO2
−
generated from the Feammox process, Fe(III), and SO4
2−
present in the medium as electron acceptors to oxidize the
deﬂuorinated or partially deﬂuorinated products from the
PFOS/PFOA deﬂuorination, resulting in the decreasing DOC
vs time in the A6 enrichment culture.
Although the short term eﬀects of PFOA and PFOS were
negligible on the Feammox activity, the microbial community
analysis from the A6 enrichment culture of samples collected
on day 0 and day 60 shows that the composition of the
community with PFOA diverged over time from that with
PFOS, while the change of the composition in samples without
PFAS was much smaller (Figure S12).
It is also interesting to note that Acidimicrobium was
dominant at the onset of the incubations (Figure S12).
Although copy numbers of A6 increased during the 60 day
incubations (more in the presence of PFOA than PFOS) the
relative population of the Acidimicrobium decreased in the
positive control incubations, more so in the presence of PFAS,
and most in the presence of PFOS. The larger relative
Acidimicrobium population in the PFOA incubations (22.6%)
vs the PFOS incubations (10.4%) is consistent with the higher
16S rRNA gene numbers of A6 in that incubation, and a higher
Feammox activity in terms of NH4
+ removal (39% higher than
in the PFOS incubation) and Fe(II) production (47% higher
than in the PFOS incubation) over the same time period. The
higher Feammox activity in the PFOA A6 enrichment culture
incubations also corresponds to a higher PFOA removal and
F−production vs PFOS removal and F−production in the
PFOS incubations. Hence, it appears that, at these rather high
concentrations, PFOS has a more detrimental eﬀect on A6
than PFOA. Further work is needed to explore the threshold
concentrations where this eﬀect becomes less marked, and if it
may have an impact on long-term PFOS bioremediation
schemes with A6.
Fluorine Balance. The results for PFOA/PFOS degradation allow for a ﬂuorine balance during each incubation, which
for the A6 enrichment culture is shown in Table 1 for PFOA
and in Table S3 for PFOS. Results show a good ﬂuorine
balance, which gives conﬁdence in the accuracy of the analyses
shown in Figures 1 and 2.

## Page 7

The same ﬂuorine balances for incubations with the pure A6
culture are shown in Table S4 for PFOA and in Table S5 for
PFOS. The ﬂuorine balance for the pure A6 culture
incubations shows a slight decreasing trend in total quantiﬁed
ﬂuorine over time for both the incubation with PFOA and with
PFOS, indicating that some ﬂuorinated intermediates might
have been present but were not detected. Standards for
partially ﬂuorinated intermediates were not available and, if
present, such compounds were not detected.
Eﬀect of Deﬂuorination on Fe(III) Reduction. As shown
by Equation 1, the expected molar ratio of Fe(II) produced to
NH4
+ oxidized is 6:1. If during the deﬂuorination process,
some electrons from the oxidation of NH4
+ are transferred to
the PFAS to free F−instead of being transferred to Fe(III) to
produce Fe(II), one should expect a commensurate decrease in
Fe(III) reduction. Results of the Fe(II)/NH4
+ ratio vs time
during the A6 enrichment culture incubations with PFOA and
PFOS are shown in Table 2 and in Table S6, respectively, and
in Table S7 and in Table S8 for the pure A6 culture with
PFOA and PFOS, respectively. The ﬁrst column in each table
shows the observed Fe(II)/NH4
+ ratio for incubations with
PFOA/PFOS, the second column shows the ratio of [Fe(II) +
F−]/NH4
+ for incubations with PFOA/PFOS, while the third
column shows the Fe(II)/NH4
+ ratio of the positive controls
that were incubated in parallel without PFOA/PFOS. The
actual Fe(II)/NH4
+ ratio observed during Feammox incubations is usually less than 6:1, which is attributed to (i) a less
eﬃcient Fe(II) extraction especially early on during the
incubations, (ii) when AQDS is present, the reduction of
AQDS and buildup of AH2QDS, which accumulates early on
during incubations,43 and (iii) the possible oxidation of Fe(II)
by NO2
−, especially when the pH is >6.44
By day 100, the Fe(II)/NH4
+ ratio in the controls without
PFOA and PFOS was between 4.6 and 4.8 in the A6
enrichment culture and between 4.8 and 5.1 in the pure A6
culture. In contrast, the respective Fe(II)/NH4
+ ratio in the
presence of these PFAS was lower (3.4 to 4.0 in the A6
enrichment culture and 4.6 and 4.8 in the pure A6 culture),
while the [Fe(II) + F−]/NH4
+ was closer to the positive
controls. These analyses suggest that these PFAS may be acting
as alternative electron acceptors to Fe(III), and hence, that the
F−production could be due to reductive deﬂuorination.
Incubations without Fe(III) (Figures S6a and S7a) did not
result in deﬂuorination, indicating that these PFAS, at the
experimental conditions described here, cannot be used as sole
electron acceptors for the growth of A6 using NH4
+ or H2 as
electron donors. Results also show that in the presence of these
PFAS, even at the high concentrations used here, the large
majority of electrons were transferred to Fe(III).
Dissolved Organic Carbon Balance. DOC analyses were
performed immediately after sampling during the 35 day
incubations, and DOC balances were performed on these 0.24
mM PFOA and 0.20 mM PFOS incubations with both NH4
+
and H2 as electron donors.
As A6 numbers increased during the incubations, with CO2
as the carbon source (Figure 1f and Figure 2f), the particulate
organic carbon (POC) increased from 1.42 mM to 2.05 mM
and from 1.29 mM to 1.78 mM in the 100 day PFOA and
PFOS pure A6 culture incubations, respectively. In contrast,
DOC remained constant over the incubation time in the pure
A6 culture (Table 3 and Table S9 as well as Figures S10f and
S11f). Although no organic carbon (except the PFAS) was
supplied to any vials, there was a background DOC in the
positive control (without PFAS), ranging from 0.18 ± 0.02 to
0.36 ± 0.03 mM over the 35 day incubations for the pure A6
and the A6 enrichment culture, respectively, which is
attributed to the long-term ﬁxation of organic carbon by this
autotroph. At 0.24 mM PFOA and 0.20 mM PFOS, their
contribution to the total DOC is an order of magnitude higher
than that of the background DOC. Given that the DOC ﬁxed
during the 35 day incubation period is negligible in comparison
to the DOC from the PFAS added, a constant DOC vs time in
the pure A6 culture incubations indicates that none of the
PFAS that were being degraded nor their degradation products
were oxidized to CO2.
DOC was measured as described above as well as estimated.
DOC as a function of incubation time was estimated based on
the concentration and molecular formula of the initial PFAS,
ﬂuorinated intermediates, and acetate for each timepoint. The
background DOC from the positive control (no PFAS) was
then added to these estimated DOC values (for the pure A6
culture: 0.18 mM for PFOA and 0.17 mM for PFOS; for the
A6 enrichment culture: 0.35 mM for PFOA and 0.38 mM for
PFOS incubations). Hence, a close match between the
measured and estimated DOC indicates that the major
dissolved organic compounds, which includes the original
PFAS and their degradation products (ﬂuorinated and
nonﬂuorinated organics), have been properly quantiﬁed.
Table 4 and Table S10 show the measured and estimated
DOC vs time for the incubations with the A6 enrichment
culture when either NH4
+ or H2 is used as electron donor, for
incubations with PFOA and PFOS, respectively. Results show
that the DOC decreased at a rate of ∼5.7 μM day−1, which is
attributed to the presence of heterotrophic bacteria that can
grow on PFOA/PFOS degradation products such as acetate
while using electron acceptors such as NO2
−(Figure S3),
Fe(III), or SO4
2−. The measured and estimated DOC values
are in close agreement, indicating that the key degradation

intermediates contributing to the DOC have been identiﬁed
and properly quantiﬁed.
Table 3 and Table S9 show the measured and estimated
DOC vs time for the incubations with the pure A6 culture with
NH4
+ or H2 as an electron donor for incubations with PFOA
and PFOS, respectively. In contrast to the A6 enrichment
culture, here the DOC remains constant with time, indicating
that, as expected, A6 does not utilize PFOA or PFOS nor any
of their degradation products as carbon source. Results again
show a good agreement between measured and estimated
DOC.
Production of Shorter Chain Fluorinated Compounds. The production during incubations with the A6
enrichment culture of shorter-chain ﬂuorinated compounds
such as HFBA, PFPeA, PFHxA, and PFHpA during the
degradation of PFOA, and the production of PFBS and HFBA
during the degradation of PFOS show that in addition to
deﬂuorination, the C−C bond of these molecules was oxidized.
Production of SO4
2−in the PFOS incubations indicates that
the C−S bond was oxidized.
Concentrations of shorter carbon chain−perﬂuorinated
intermediates and of acetate in the incubations with the pure
A6 culture were much lower than those in the A6 enrichment
culture and not detected when H2 was the electron donor. As
mentioned above, the decrease over time in total ﬂuorine
quantiﬁed (0.56 mM for PFOA and 0.58 mM for PFOS over
100 days, Tables S4 and S5) indicates the possibility of the
formation and accumulation of other ﬂuorinated organics in
the pure A6 culture that were not detected. Hence, further
research is needed to determine what ﬂuorinated intermediates
that have not been identiﬁed here might be produced, and
when and to what degree the pure A6 culture is capable of
breaking the C−C bond.
Although the Feammox activity in the pure and enriched A6
culture was similar in terms of NH4
+ removed and Fe(II)
produced as well as A6 numbers, the A6 enrichment culture
had a higher overall PFOA and PFOS removal and production
of smaller perﬂuorinated compounds, acetate, and F−. This
indicates the possibility of a synergistic interaction between A6
and other organisms in the A6 enrichment culture during the
degradation of these PFAS, where once a perﬂuorinated
compound has been partially deﬂuorinated by A6, heterotrophs in the A6 enrichment culture are capable of further
degrading these intermediates. Since A6 is an autotroph and no
organic carbon was added to the incubations, the increase in
acetate above that in the positive control during the
incubations with the PFAS, coupled with the carbon balance,
indicates that complete deﬂuorination of PFOA and PFOS
may be achieved by these cultures. Incubations with
13Clabeled PFAS will have to be conducted to conﬁrm that the
acetate is a product from the PFAS degradation.
Possible Environmental Settings for PFAS Remediation via Feammox. Given that the Feammox process has
been reported in many environmental settings, as long as the
pH is acidic and soils are iron rich, the results presented here
indicate that under the right conditions, the Feammox process
could be stimulated to achieve PFAS biodegradation in
contaminated sediments and groundwater systems. The
Feammox process has been stimulated successfully in
constructed wetland mesocosms45 and microbial electrolysis
cells46 for the removal of NH4
+ and in soil columns for the
removal of TCE.29
