ABSTRACT: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are
recalcitrant contaminants of emerging concern. Research efforts have
been dedicated to PFAS microbial biotransformation in the hopes of
developing treatment technologies using microorganisms as catalysts.
Here, we performed a meta-analysis by extracting and standardizing
quantitative data from 97 microbial PFAS biotransformation studies
and comparing outcomes via statistical tests. This meta-analysis
indicated that the likelihood of PFAS biotransformation was higher
under aerobic conditions, in experiments with defined or axenic
cultures, when high concentrations of PFAS were used, and when
PFAS contained fewer fluorine atoms in the molecule. This metaanalysis also documented that PFAS biotransformation depends on
chain length, chain branching geometries, and headgroup chemistry.
We found that the literature is scarce or lacking in (i) anaerobic PFAS biotransformation experiments with well-defined electron
acceptors, electron donors, carbon sources, and oxidation−reduction potentials, (ii) analyses of PFAS biotransformation products,
and (iii) analyses to identify microorganisms and enzymes responsible for PFAS biotransformation. To date, most biotransformation
research emphasis has been on 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (8:2 FTOH), 6:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (6:2 FTOH),
perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). A wide array of PFAS remains to be tested for their
potential to biotransform.

■INTRODUCTION: PFAS, A BRIEF OVERVIEW AND
THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL RELEVANCE
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are contaminants
of concern for human and environmental health because of
their wide distribution, degradation recalcitrance, bioaccumulation tendencies, and toxicological effects.1−9 The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
defines PFAS as fluorinated substances that contain at least
one fully fluorinated methyl or methylene carbon (C) atom
(without any hydrogen, chlorine (Cl), bromine, or iodine
atoms attached to it).10 The possibility of PFAS biotransformation or biodegradation is often dismissed out of hand: PFAS
are the “forever chemicals”.11−13 This review revisits this
“conventional wisdom” by synthesizing research outcomes
from studies of the microbial biotransformation of diverse
PFAS molecules. Here, we examine microbiological PFAS
transformation studies, regardless of outcome, in order to
synthesize PFAS biotransformation knowledge. Although
reviews of PFAS biotransformation processes and pathways
exist,14−33 to the authors’ knowledge, meta-analyses of
microbial PFAS biotransformation have not been performed
on the existing literature. Our overarching goal was to identify
the conditions under which PFAS biotransformation is known
to or may occur. Overall, we document that PFAS
biotransformation or lack thereof is dependent on a variety
of factors including chain length, chain branching geometries,
whether the molecule is fully saturated with fluorine (F) atoms,
headgroup chemistry, among others. In general, PFAS
molecules that are fully saturated and have longer C chains
are less likely to be susceptible to microbial biotransformation.
PFAS are human-made substances used for surface coatings
due to their surfactant properties.34 The C−F bond is the
strongest covalent bond and is considered the main factor
limiting PFAS biotransformation.14,15,35−37 The three electron
pairs that surround each F atom and the shielding of C atoms
by F atoms render PFAS resistant to reactions with acids,
bases, reductants, and oxidants.34 A perspective on C−F

chemistry depicted greater complexity of C−F bond cleavage
due to variability in bond strength, location relative to other
(non C−F) bonds, the relative hydrophobicity of perfluorocarbons, and the toxicity of the free fluoride ion (F−), among
other factors.26
PFAS have various industrial purposes that involve lowering
surface tension, facilitating foam spreading, and fire smothering. PFAS are used in the manufacture of a wide variety of
consumer goods and aqueous film forming foams (AFFFs)
used to extinguish hydrocarbon and solvent-based fires.38,39 As
longer chain PFAS are undergoing increased scrutiny and
regulation, there is a transition to incorporate more shorterchain and branched PFAS into the product design. Further
toxicological research is necessary to understand the human
health and environmental implications of this transition.40−43
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic
acid (PFOS) production in the United States has been phased
out, although importation continues.44 In 2024, the US
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) added nine PFAS,
their salts, and their structural isomers to its list of hazardous
constituents in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA)−PFOA, FOS, perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS),
hexafluoropropylene oxide-dimer acid (HFPO−DA, commonly known as GenX chemicals), perfluorononanoic acid
(PFNA), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorodecanoic acid, perfluorohexanoic acid, and perfluorobutanoic
acid.7,9,45 Additionally, the EPA has added final National
Primary Drinking Water Regulation (NPDWR) for six PFAS at
low ppt levels: PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO−DA, and
mixtures containing two or more of PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO−
DA, and PFBS.46
PFAS are structurally and compositionally diverse and have
been categorized broadly into perfluoroalkyl substances,
polyfluoroalkyl substances, and polymeric substances.47 Figure
1 depicts this categorization. Polymers are multifluorinated
repeating moieties of many subclasses.47 Perfluoroalkyl
substances are compounds where F atoms occupy all binding
sites on the C chain, except for Cs associated with a functional
group (e.g., the C−S bond of the sulfonic group in PFOS).
Nonpolymer fluoroalkyl substances include perfluoroalkyl and
polyfluoroalkyl substances. Polyfluoroalkyl substances are
compounds that have at least two F atoms but are not fully
saturated with Fs (e.g., 6:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (6:2 FTOH)
and 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (8:2 FTOH) in Figure 1; see
also Buck et al.47). PFAS are surfactants because they are
comprised of an oleophobic and hydrophobic perfluorocarbon
tail and a hydrophilic charged head.34
PFAS manufacture began in the 1940s.6 In the 1960s,
various chemical manufacturers created formulations of PFAScontaining AFFFs to extinguish flammable-liquid fires.6 After
the initial manufacture of PFAS for firefighting, a proliferation
occurred across the consumer marketplace with PFAS
incorporated into products such as water-repellent outdoor
gear, nonstick cookware, and stain-resistant carpeting and
furniture. It was estimated that up to 6900 t of PFAS were
released between 1951 and 2004.48 An estimate from 2017
forecasted a release of up to 6420 t of PFAS in the
environment by 2030.49
PFAS emissions exist in air, water, and soil and migrate
between these media. Here, we focus on water and soil, as they
are the media where PFAS microbial biotransformation is most
likely to occur. PFAS emissions to surface water and
groundwater include releases from manufacturing sites, use
and disposal of PFAS-containing consumer products, firefighting/crash training facilities, wastewater facilities, and use
of contaminated biosolids.48,50,51 Due to their low pKa values
(0.5−3.8), a majority of perfluoroalkyls exist as dissociated
conjugate bases at the environmentally relevant pH range of 5
to 9.52,53 As PFAS have weak van der Waals interactions, they
do not form strong intermolecular relationships with their
surrounding phase and, thus, tend to move into the
atmosphere.54
Marine currents and aerosols transport PFAS over long
distances due to their surfactant properties and accumulation

in upper sea surface microlayers.48,55 While Koc values do not
exist for many perfluoroalkyls, PFOA’s log Koc (2.06 L kg−1
oc)
and PFOS’s log Koc (2.57−3.1 L kg−1
oc) indicate that they will
not adsorb strongly to soil or sediment but will be moderately
mobile in groundwater.48,50,56,57 Perfluoroalkyls migrate in
groundwater rather than remain at the initial source location.
In water, PFOS and PFOA have been shown to be stable, with
pH-independent hydrolysis reaction half-lives of 41 and 92
year, respectively.58 Fluorotelomer alcohols and perfluoroalkyl
sulfonamides may transform to PFOA and PFOS in water or
soil and, therefore, can be precursors or sources of these
substances.59,60 We discuss PFAS biotransformation at length
in later sections. PFAS contamination is ubiquitous and
persistent, necessitating remediation.61 The cost-prohibitive
and ex situ nature of engineered treatment technologies
provides an opportunity to explore PFAS biotransformation
for in situ remediation. Using PFAS biotransformation for in
situ treatment would be beneficial because of the large number
of PFAS-contaminated sites, the low cleanup limits established,
and public health implications. Future successes in the
development of foundational knowledge for PFAS biotransformation could lead to comprehensive watershed and
organismal protection via nature-based sustainable approaches.
This study provides a synopsis and a meta-analysis of the
PFAS microbial biotransformation literature up to 2023.
Trends and promising developments in PFAS biotransformation research include a growing number of studies being
published each year as the impetus from public health concern,
regulation, and scientific knowledge grow. In the field of
microbial PFAS biotransformation, a preponderance of studies
has been conducted under aerobic conditions, but a few
studies also documented anaerobic biotransformation of some
PFAS. While PFAS were originally thought to be recalcitrant
compounds, microbes able to biotransform PFAS aerobically
or anaerobically have been identified; this makes it possible to
begin to establish PFAS structure- and condition-dependent
PFAS biotransformation relationships. We can possibly gain
insights into PFAS defluorination using microbial dechlorination as a guide. Furthermore, we identify needed conventions
of PFAS microbial biotransformation studies to produce
foundational knowledge that should hasten the development
of PFAS bioremediation technologies.
■METHODS
We reviewed 97 published studies from 1989 to 2023. The
surveyed studies contained 288 experimental conditions and
researched the ability of microorganisms to biotransform or
biodegrade more than 100 fluorinated compounds, most of
which were PFAS. For the purposes of this analysis, we define
experimental conditions as a unique experimental setup with
independent results. Therefore, publications typically have
multiple experimental conditions. Examples of setup changes
that were considered as unique experimental conditions within
one publication include changes in fluorinated compound
tested, changes in fluorinated compound concentration,
addition of nonfluorinated substrates, or incubation with a
different culture, among others.
Approximately 79% of the included studies used PFAS. The
remaining studies used simple fluorinated substances such as
fluorobenzene, sodium fluoroacetate, and 1-fluorodecane,
among others. While PFAS are the focus of this meta-analysis,
biotransformation studies of simple fluorinated compounds
may also provide insights into conditions for PFAS microbial
biotransformation.62 To facilitate comparisons between
studies, we converted aqueous PFAS concentrations to mM,
converted dosages expressed as mass-to-mass ratio to mg kg−1
of soil or sludge, and converted incubation time to days (d).
The concentration of F−released during incubation (mM) was
used to calculate a total F−released (%) relative to the original
fluorinated substance.
We used qualitative parameters (e.g., aerobic and anaerobic
incubation conditions) to divide the experimental conditions
into subclasses. For the purposes of this study, we defined
biotransformation as the change in the bond structure or redox
state of a molecule. We defined biodegradation as the
breakdown of C bonds within a molecule. In our analyses,
we categorized PFAS to be biotransformed when the original
publication asserted that biotransformation occurred from
evidence of (i) a decrease in the concentration of the tested
PFAS or (ii) detection of transformation products. We
categorized a PFAS to be biodefluorinated when criteria (i)
and (ii) were met but also when there was (iii) an increase in
F−concentration and/or (iv) a mass balance demonstrating
biodefluorination. The meta-analysis yielded 236 experimental
conditions as aerobic and 52 experimental conditions as
anaerobic from 97 studies. We used a student’s t test to search
out statistical differences between quantitative categorizations,
where p > 0.05 = not significant (NS), p < 0.05 > 0.01 = *, p <
0.01 > 0.001 = **, and p < 0.001 = ***. The parameters
extracted from all studies are listed in Table S1 in the
Supporting Information.
■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
This meta-analysis of PFAS biotransformation was conducted
with the objective of identifying trends in experimental
conditions linked with promising biotransformation and
biodefluorination outcomes. Of the 288 experimental conditions reviewed in 97 studies, 82% were set up under aerobic
conditions. The most frequently tested PFAS were 8:2 FTOH
(11 studies),59,60,63−70 6:2 FTOH (9 studies),65,67,71−77 PFOS
(7 studies),78−84 PFOA (10 studies),36,62,82−89 and 6:2 FTSA
(4 studies).77,80,90,91 Only 7% of analyzed studies investigated
biotransformation of mixtures of PFAS.92−97 The focus on
PFAS biotransformation in aerobic conditions is opposite to
the intense focus on dehalogenation of chlorinated compounds
under anaerobic conditions.98
Figure 2 summarizes the temporal trends, experimental
conditions (aerobic or anaerobic), and outcomes in the PFAS
microbial biotransformation literature. Most of the reviewed
studies (82%) documented the biotransformation of fluorinated chemicals (Figure 2A-C), but a concentration of F−
released was reported in only 41% of the studies. Evidence for
biotransformation in the studies without concentrations of F−
included decreases in PFAS concentrations, the detection of
fluorinated transformation products, and indicators of microbial growth. As of June 2023, F−released from polyfluorinated
compounds, including PFAS, at ≥90% was described in 4 out
of 28 studies (Figure 2B−C).78,99−101 In contrast, 14
publications (22 experimental conditions) showed >90% F−
release for monofluorinated compounds under aerobic
conditions (Figure 2B−C).
Aerobic Studies with Some Documentation of
Biotransformation. Of the 236 aerobic microbial biotransformation experimental conditions, 92% documented biotransformation of fluorinated molecules in live treatments and
no biotransformation in sterile controls (Figure 2B). This

preponderance of biotransformation points to a need to move
away from viewing PFAS as “forever chemicals”. Of the studies
that achieved F−release with PFAS containing 3−17 F atoms,
the average release was 45% ± 37% of the total possible F−
concentration, and 29 experimental conditions documented F−
release of at least 90%. In studies with PFAS containing greater
than 5 F atoms, only 27 experimental conditions documented
F−release (2-amino-5-(pentafluorosulfanyl)phenol, 4:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (4:2 FTOH), 6:2 FTOH, 6:2 fluorotelomer
sulfonate (6:2 FTS), 6:2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic
acid
(6:2
FTUCA),
8:2
FTOH,
4,4,4-trifluoro-3-
(trifluoromethyl)crotonic acid (MeUC 5d), PFOA, and
PFOS).59,60,65,71,76−78,81,87,102−106 The highest F−released
from these experimental conditions was 80%, while the average
was 17% ± 27%.59,60,65,71,76−78,81,87,102−106
The first documentation of aerobic perfluoroalkyl acid
biotransformation occurred with Pseudomonas sp. strain D2.
Strain D2 was reported to biotransform 1H,1H,2H,2Hperfluorooctanesulfonate (H-PFOS) to six volatile transformation products containing oxygen and F but not sulfur.78
However, PFOS was not biotransformed by strain D2.78
Pseudomonas plecoglossicida 2.4-D was later shown to use PFOS
as a sole source of C with complete utilization in 6 d while
transforming PFOS to perfluoroheptanoic (perfluoroenanthic)
acid and releasing F−.81 Additionally, Delftia acidovorans, a
microorganism with several haloacid dehalogenases identified
in its genome, can grow with PFOA as a sole C source.81
Aerobic fluorotelomer-based substance biotransformation
has also achieved significant breakthroughs. 8:2 FTOH was
found to be biologically defluorinated and mineralized under
conditions that may occur in wastewater treatment plants
forming shorter-chain metabolites.59 Research with 8:2 FTOH
showed that Pseudomonas species OCY4 and OCW4 transformed 8:2 FTOH using octanol as a C source, possibly via a
cometabolic process.60 A successive study on 6:2 FTOH
showed a short half-life (<2 d) and indicated that alternate
biotransformation pathways from those for 8:2 FTOH were
likely preferential, removing multiple −CF2−groups.71 The
same research team then compared 6:2 FTS biotransformation
to 6:2 FTOH.102 Results showed that 6:2 FTS was
biotransformed by activated sludge from wastewater treatment
plants at a lower rate (63.7% of 6:2 FTS concentration
remaining at 90 days), possibly due to slow aerobic
desulfonation. It was concluded that 6:2 FTS is an unlikely
major source of perfluorinated transformation products in
wastewater effluent.102
Dietzia aurantiaca J3 was also shown to biotransform 6:2
FTS with alkanesulfonate monooxygenase and alkanesulfonate
ABC transporters upregulated in the presence of 6:2 FTS.104 A
study with Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 demonstrated defluorination and desulfonation of 6:2 FTSA.77 Desulfonation of 6:2
FTSA was a requisite prior to defluorination, and a higher
expression of alkane monooxygenase was linked to concurrent
biotransformation of 6:2 FTOH.77 The understanding of
fluorotelomer alcohol biotransformation was also enhanced by
studies with Pseudomonas butanovora (butane oxidizer) and
Pseudomonas oleovorans (octane oxidizer). These strains
defluorinated 4:2 FTOH, 6:2 FTOH, and 8:2 FTOH with a
greater defluorination for 4:2 FTOH.65
Incubation periods in aerobic studies ranged from 3 h (0.125
d) to 730 d, with an average incubation period of 36 ± 80 d.
Contaminant concentrations ranged over several orders of
magnitude: 3 to 1000 μmol PFAS g−1 soil and 3 nM to 20 mM
PFAS in water. In studies employing a mixed culture or a
microbiome, the microorganisms responsible for PFAS
biotransformation were only identified in seven studies.70,76,107−111 Microbes from 19 genera have been identified
to biotransform fluorinated compounds under aerobic
conditions (Table S2). Based on the number of experimental
conditions, the most studied genus was Pseudomonas, followed
by Rhodococcus and Labrys (Table S2). Biotransformation of
PFAS by mixed cultures has been observed, but the microbial
community was not analyzed or reported. Therefore, those

Aerobic Studies without Biotransformation. Compounds not biotransformed under aerobic conditions in
surveyed studies included trifluoromethanesulfonic acid
(TFMS), PFOS, PFOA, EtFOSE-based phosphate diester
(SAmPAP Diester), perfluoropropionic acid (PFPrA), 3Hperfluoro-3-[(3-methoxy-propoxy)propanoic acid (3HPFPrA), toluene-2,4-di(8:2 fluorotelomer urethane), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), Gen X, and three PFAS
mixtures.36,75,78,80,85,93,95−97,105 In the aerobic subset of the
database, the compound with the highest F content had 34 F
atoms per molecule (8:2 fluorotelomer urethane), and the
average F number was 18.7. Not counting the PFAS
mixtures,93,96,97 the average molecular weight was 352 g−1

mol. Compared to the average molecular weight of 291 g
mol−1 of all the fluorinated compounds in this meta-analysis,
these nonbiotransformed molecules had higher F content and
molecular weight. Figures 3A and S1 illustrate that PFAS with
a higher molecular weight are less likely to be defluorinated
aerobically.
Anaerobic Studies with Documentation of Biotransformation. PFAS-biotransformation studies under anaerobic
conditions are relatively few: 52 anaerobic experimental
conditions were surveyed, with 72% having some documentation of PFAS biotransformation and 46% showing a
concentration of F−was released during incubation (Figure
2C).82,84,88,89,105,124−132 The most frequently studied compounds were PFOA (10 experimental conditions), PFOS (4
experimental conditions), and 6:2 FTSA (5 experimental
conditions). The incubation periods ranged from 1.25 to 341
d, with an average incubation period of 90 ± 93 d. Of the 37
anaerobic studies documenting biotransformation, inocula
included axenic bacterial cultures (10 studies), soils (7
studies), reductively dechlorinating mixed microbial cultures
(11 studies), a Feammox culture (6 studies), and wastewater
activated sludges (3 studies). Table S3 tabulates the microorganisms associated with the biotransformation of PFAS in
anaerobic conditions. Studies utilizing pure or enrichment
cultures included Pseudomonas oleovorans and Pseudomonas
butanovora, Acidimicrobium sp. strain A6, the reductively
dechlorinating culture KB-1, and a mixed culture derived
from an AFFF site. Only a few examples are available for
anaerobic PFAS-degrading mixed cultures.69,82,105,129 Three
anaerobic studies with mixed cultures included analyses of the
microbial community composition. However, putative defluorinating microbes were not identified, and, thus, those
studies were not included in Table S3.105,131,133
In a study where culture KB-1, an enrichment culture
containing Dehalococcoides mccartyi, was tested under anaerobic conditions, incubations achieved >90% removal for (E)-
perfluoro(4-methylpent-2-enoic acid) (PFMeUPA) (14%
biodefluorination) and 4,5,5,5-tetrafluoro-4-(trifluoromethyl)-
2-pentenoic acid (FTMeUPA) (4−5% biodefluorination) in
150 and 70 d, respectively.131 Geobacter and Dehalobacter were
assessed for their involvement in biodefluorination.131 Geobacter showed no growth in PFMeUPA-fed culture, but
Dehalobacter exhibited growth in PFMeUPA/FTMeUPA-fed
culture. When the defluorination capabilities of Dehalobacter
restrictus strain PER-K23 were examined, F−was not released
from PFMeUPA and FTMeUPA.131 Culture KB-1 was also
evaluated in a study on the importance of C double bonds in
microbial defluorination of unsaturated per- and polyfluorinated carboxylic acids.105 It was found that α,β-unsaturation
was key for reductive defluorination and hydrogenation of
fluorinated carboxylic acids. Additionally, reductive defluorination was less favorable than hydrogenation of the double
bonds, and unsaturated fluorinated carboxylic acid structures
with trifluoromethyl (−CF3) branches at the α/β-carbon had
greater degradability.105 Finally, a culture derived from an
AFFF-containing site was shown to transform 65−84% of the
concentration of 6:2 fluorotelomer thioether amido sulfonate
(6:2 FtTAoS at 20 μM) in 300 days under nitrate-reducing
conditions, while 6:2 FtTAoS biotransformation was slower
under sulfate-reducing conditions.133 These recent studies,
which are breakthroughs in documenting PFAS biotransformation and defluorination under anaerobic conditions (Figure
2C),69,82,84,88,89,131,133 may enable tailored design of degradable fluorinated compounds as alternatives to existing PFAS.
Anaerobic Studies without Biotransformation. Of all
anaerobic experiments, 29% did not achieve biotransformation.80,85,90,93,105,125 The range of F atoms in these PFAS was
between 3 and 17 per molecule (average 9.6 F per molecule).
The molecular weight of PFAS compounds tested under
anaerobic conditions where biotransformation was not
recorded ranged from 113 to 500 g mol−1 (avg. 349 g
mol−1), which is above the average molecular weight of 291 g
mol−1 (Figure 3B). The molecular weight is an important
metric as molecules with a higher molecular weight may have
longer C chains and therefore also more Fs. In contrast to
aerobic studies, anaerobic conditions did not show a
statistically significant relationship between molecular weight
and extent of defluorination (Figure 3B).
PFAS Category-Specific Biotransformation Trends.
PFAS chemical structure affects biotransformation, but only
a few PFAS subtypes have been extensively studied. Analyses
by PFAS subtype could identify structural factors relevant to
enhancing or suppressing biotransformation or biodegradation.
Figure 4, which illustrates whether PFAS subtypes have been
studied for their biotransformation potential, highlights that
microbial biotransformation experiments have not been
conducted for about 50% of the categories (shown in black
lines, Figure 4). This is consistent with the nascency of this
field and underscores that thousands of PFAS have yet to be
assessed for microbial biotransformation.

Figure 4 divides PFAS into secondary (polyfluoroalkyl
substances, perfluoroalkyl substances, polymers), tertiary (i.e.,
fluorotelomer-based substances, side-chain fluorinated polymers), and quaternary (i.e., perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids
(PFCAs), n:2 fluorotelomer phosphates (n:2 PAPs)) categories. While all secondary categories have been explored to
some degree, seven tertiary and 11 quaternary categories
remain unexamined (Figure 4). Of the PFAS categorizations
that have been explored, research has been focused on
fluorotelomer substances and perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs).
Table S5 presents the outcomes of fluorotelomer substances
under experimental conditions. In the following sections, we
describe microbial biotransformation trends first by category
and then by specific substances nested within that category.
Due to the complexity of PFAS categorizations and data
limitation, we focused the analysis on categories and
substances that appear more frequently in the literature.
Biotransformation of PFAS Categorized as n:2
Compounds. PFAS categorized as n:2 compounds have C
chains of varying lengths (n) and differing head groups (e.g.,
alcohol, urethane). We compared studies with the same
headgroup (FTOHs) at different C chain lengths to evaluate
the effect of C chain length on biotransformation. PFAS as n:2
FTOHs tested for microbial biotransformation ranged in
length from four C (4:2) to eight C (8:2). Our comparison
showed that % F−released decreases with increasing C chain
length (Table 1). All 4:2 FTOH and 6:2 FTOH experiments
were performed under aerobic conditions. Of the 26
experimental conditions with 8:2 FTOH, 23 were performed
under aerobic conditions. The three 8:2 FTOH conditions
carried out anaerobically were from a single study where 8:2
FTOH was shown to biotransform but the concentration of F−
was not measured.69 8:2 FTOH biotransformation under
nitrate-, sulfate-, and iron-reducing conditions revealed differences in biotransformation products and extent of biotransformation of 8:2 FTOH. Nitrate-reducing conditions resulted
in the greatest 8:2 FTOH biotransformation and more diverse
biotransformation products.69
We also compared biotransformation at a set chain length
with different head groups to assess how head groups affect

biotransformation. When comparing 8:2 compounds that
contain 17 F (8:2 FTCA, 8:2 FTSA, and 8:2 FTUCA) to
8:2 FTOH, the non-8:2 FTOH compounds achieved 68−
100% biotransformation, while 8:2 FTOH was less biotransformed (59% avg.).113,114,117 8:2 FTOH appears to be
biotransformed to a lesser extent than other 8:2 compounds
due to the alcohol moiety. These trends in PFAS categorized
as n:2-compounds reinforce that recalcitrance to biotransformation increases with chain length and, thus, the number of F
atoms. However, how the headgroup of PFAS influences
biotransformation for a set C chain length is a topic just
beginning to be explored.77,91,113,122,132 There is a pressing
need for analyses of how similar PFAS are biodegraded
depending on C chain length, F saturation, head groups, and
bond placement.105
Biotransformation of PFOS and PFOA. Comparing
PFOS and PFOA biotransformation is important because these
EPA-regulated PFAS are considered to be dead-end transformation products from the thousands of PFAA precursor
compounds in commerce.137 PFOS and PFOA may be ratelimiting for PFAS biotransformation. To date, multiple studies
reported
no
biotransformation
for
PFOA
and
PFOS.36,78,80,85,86 Though considered “forever” dead-ends,
some evidence from the literature suggests that PFOA and
PFOS can biotransform, and, in some cases, they can
defluorinate.62,81,83,84,87−89 Transformation products of
PFOA and PFOS identified to date include PFBS, PFHxS,
heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA), perfluoropentanoic acid
(PFPeA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), and perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA).84,87−89 The literature shows that PFOA
is biotransformed more frequently than PFOS (Table S7).
However, the extent of biotransformation (% PFAS transformed) and microbial defluorination (% F−released) was not
significantly different when comparing PFOA to PFOS (Table
S7).
While PFOA and PFOS biotransformation is the current
frontier in this field, multiple seminal studies have received
critiques
about
their
methodologies
and
conclusions.79,82,138−141 For the advancement of PFAS microbial
treatment, it is important that researchers incorporate rigorous
variable-isolating experimental designs and appropriate analytical methodologies. A study reported that PFOS biotransformation occurred under aerobic conditions in experiments with Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain HJ4,79 but these
results were later contested138,139 and have yet to be
reproduced by others. Acidimicrobium sp. strain A6 was
reported to degrade PFOA and PFOS with a buildup of
shorter-chain perfluorinated transformation products and
release of F−.82 Acidimicrobium sp. strain A6 is a Feammox
autotroph that anaerobically oxidizes ammonium to nitrite
while reducing ferric iron.82 Strain A6 can use either
ammonium or H2 as the electron donor.82 The tested PFOA
concentrations were degraded at 50% (0.12 mM PFOA initial)
by the A6 enrichment culture and 33% (0.08 mM PFOA
initial) by strain A6 pure culture in 100 d.82 The A6
enrichment culture was reported to degrade the concentration
of PFOS by 47% (initial of 0.093 mM), while the pure A6
culture degraded 23% of the initial (0.045 mM) PFOS
concentration in 100 d.82 Acidimicrobium sp. strain A6 was also
tested in a microbial electrolysis cell and in biosolids; results
showed 60% and 70% transformation of 100 mg L−1 PFOA in
18 and 150 d, respectively.88,89 Experimental studies with
Acidimicrobium strain A6 were followed by modeling studies
comparing PFOA degradation kinetics for the following
conditions: differing PFOA concentrations, varying abundance
of strain A6, and semicontinuous growth conditions.84
Coupling the experiments with modeling led to an
interpretation that the rate of PFOA defluorination was
proportional to the ammonium-oxidation rate. The rates of
defluorination and ammonium oxidation increased monotonically in a nonlinear fashion with greater abundance or biomass
of strain A6.84 While promising, there is current contention
over the veracity and replicability of PFOA and PFOS
biotransformation by Acidimicrobium sp. strain A6. Concerns
have been raised about possible complicating factors82
regarding abiotic removal via adsorption of PFAAs to
ferrihydrite, the unvalidated use of a TOC analyzer to track
C mass balance for PFAAs, and the implausibility of the
proposed microbial degradation mechanisms.140
Analyses of PFAS Structure-Dependent Biotransformation. To extract structure dependent relationships to
biotransformation, we first compared the PFAS categories,
PFAAs and fluorotelomer-based substances. Fluorotelomerbased substances exhibited significantly greater biotransformation (%) than PFAAs (Figure S3). Second, we compared
subcategories within the PFAAs (PFCAs, PFPiAs, and PFSAs)
and fluorotelomer-based substances (n:3 acids, n:2 FTSAs, n:2
FTCAs, n:2 FTOH) (see Figure S4). We found that there are
no statistically significant differences between PFAS biotransformation (%) and F−released (%) for the PFAA
subcategories, PFCAs, PFPiAs, and PFSAs (Figure S4). Within
the fluorotelomer-based substance subcategories, n:2 FTSAs
showed greater biotransformation (%) than n:3 acids, n:2
FTCAs exhibited greater biotransformation (%) than n:2
FTOHs, and n:2 FTOHs displayed a greater F−release (%)
than any of the other tested fluorotelomer subcategories
(Figure S4). The latter results may be, in part, a consequence
of the disproportionate research efforts in n:2 FTOH
biotransformation compared to the other fluorotelomer-based
substance subcategories.
Fluorotelomer substances with a set C chain length and
number of F have different functional groups, e.g., alcohol,
iodides, sulfonate, and carboxylic acids (Figure S5). Only n:2
compounds could be investigated for a relationship between
biotransformation and functional groups at a set C chain
length and F atom number (Figure S5). Statistical analyses
showed no significant differences in biotransformation (%) or
F−released (%) for 6:2 compounds. 8:2 FTOH had greater
transformation (%) than 8:2 FTS, but no significant differences
in F−released (%) were noted for 8:2 substances as 8:2 FTOH
(Figure S5). These are first glimpses into the complex
structure-dependent biotransformation of PFAS and should
not be viewed as prescriptive.
Overall Trends in PFAS Biotransformation. Our metaanalysis of the PFAS literature sought trends in successes and
lack thereof for biotransformation of PFAS. The following are
some overall trends, which may help elucidate experimental
next steps. Of the experimental conditions reviewed, 82% were
aerobic, with only 18% being anaerobic. PFAS was
biotransformed and biodefluorinated in 92% and 51% of the
aerobic studies, respectively. Anaerobic studies documented
PFAS biotransformation and microbial defluorination in 71%
and 46% of the studies, respectively. While the overall
percentages are similar, F−release was documented much
more frequently in aerobic studies (Figure 3D). Further
research is necessary to substantiate that PFAS biotransformaEnvironmental Science & Technology

tion and, especially, biodefluorination are faster and more
complete under aerobic conditions.
Experiments using cultures isolated/enriched from soils
rather than sludges had a higher PFAS biotransformation
(Figure 3E), which may provide guidance for using soils as
good sources of PFAS biotransforming microorganisms.
According to the database used in our study, only a few
anaerobic studies have shown F−release when an organic
electron donor was provided (Figure 3F).105,131 The only
studies to demonstrate F−release and PFAS reductive
defluorination and hydrogenation under anaerobic conditions
in the presence of an additional organic donor used KB-1
culture and either lactate or acetate.105,131 The comparison in
Figure 3F includes data from different PFAS (e.g., different
chemical structures) with and without an additional C source.
A comparison of specific PFAS (e.g., same chemical structure)
with and without an additional C source will provide critical
insights into the role of non-PFAS C sources on PFAS fate and
biotransformation. Such comparative analysis was not possible
at the time of writing this manuscript due to the scarcity of
data.
Conditions that correlated with a higher likelihood of or
more extensive biotransformation were aerobic conditions,
pure/defined cultures, higher concentrations of PFAS, and
fewer F atoms in the fluorinated substance. Nonideal
conditions for PFAS biotransformation−i.e., a lower likelihood
of biotransformation or biodefluorination−included anaerobic
conditions, mixed cultures, a heavily fluorinated substrate at a
low concentration, and the presence of an additional
nonfluorinated C source. PFAS with a higher number of F
atoms exhibited significantly less transformation (%) and less
total F−released (%) (Figure S2). For metabolic PFAS
biotransformation, the presence of a nonfluorinated C source
may decrease the likelihood of PFAS utilization as a C course,
as microbes may preferentially utilize the nonfluorinated, labile
C sources. For cometabolic reactions where a non-PFAS C
source or electron donor is required (one compound serving as
both the C source and electron donor), the type of growth
substrate needed to elicit the production of PFAS-relevant
cometabolism enzymes is the subject of much current
research.33,60,77,85,109,132
We noted that significant differences exist between PFAS
biotransformation (%) and total F−released (%) for wellstudied PFAS categories (n:2 FTOH, n:2 FTCA, n:2 FTSA,
n:3 acid, PFCA, PFPIA, PFSA) (Figure S2). Fluorotelomer
substances have significantly higher biotransformation (%)
than do PFAAs (Figure S3). Within fluorotelomer substances,
n:2 FTOH was the subcategory with the highest degree of
biotransformation (Figure S4). We were not able to determine
which functional group results in an increased likelihood of
biotransformation for compounds of a set C chain length and
number of Fs (Figure S5). Importantly, these trends are
derived from the existing literature surveyed for the purpose of
this study. Due to the limitations of performing a meta-analysis
on diverse and complex multivariable research, we cannot, with
certainty, attribute differences in biotransformation potential to
a single factor. The trends highlighted in this study are meant
to be informative of factors which appear to be important in
determining PFAS biotransformation potential. Further
experimentation that employs a wider range of redox
conditions and more effectively explores the structure-dependent relationships of PFAS defluorination surely will lead to
reassessment or revisions of these trends.
The observed trends and the bacteria known to biotransform
PFAS (Tables S2 and S3) make it clear that our understanding
of PFAS biotransformation is deficient. A systematic approach
to studying PFAS biotransformation is needed to avoid
experimental repetition while gleaning the most information
from each experimental condition.
Comparison of Derived PFAS Trends to Microbial
Dechlorination. As Cl and F are halogens, dechlorination
trends may provide insights into which defluorination
experiments might yield greater F−release. Microbial
dechlorination is a much more developed field than microbial
defluorination due to chlorinated organics being long-standing
regulated contaminants. Furthermore, the strength of C−Cl
bonds is small compared to C−F bonds.20,24,98,142 Microbial
dechlorination processes frequently applied for the bioremediation of chlorinated compounds, such as chlorinated ethenes,
include reductive dechlorination in anaerobic conditions and
cometabolism in aerobic conditions.
Reductive dechlorination rates and extent have been
documented to diminish because of an insufficient electrondonor supply, competition for hydrogen (H2) from the activity
of other terminal electron-accepting microbial processes, a
paucity of the specialized bacteria capable of dechlorinating
some intermediates, and the presence of inhibitory compounds, among others.98,143−146 Complete reductive dechlorination occurs only under highly reducing conditions: sulfatereducing or methanogenic.143,147 In aerobic conditions, the
following factors can limit cometabolic dechlorination:
increasing Cl saturation, too little dissolved oxygen, toxicity
of transformation products, and competitive inhibition by cocontaminants or cometabolites.148,149
Biotransformation of PFAS may depend on some of the
same factors. For example, recent studies demonstrated PFAS
defluorination by reductively dechlorinating cultures and by
either stimulation or inhibition of parallel reductive dechlorination, depending on the microbial culture used and PFAS
concentration.105,131,145,150−152 This uncertainty of PFAS’s
effect on reductive dechlorination complicates bioremediation
implementations as many contaminated sites have chlorinated
contaminants and PFAS present. The value of reductive
dechlorination makes plain the importance of further PFAS
biotransformation research under anaerobic conditions. The
small literature on PFAS biotransformation under anaerobic
conditions generally does not well define the redox conditions.
As anaerobic microbial PFAS biotransformation may occur
under a limited range of oxidation−reduction potential,
defining, monitoring, and purposefully altering such conditions
during experimentation may lead to breakthroughs and more
easily reproducible results. (Homo)acetogenesis and methanogenesis are processes typically co-occurring and/or competing
with reductive dechlorination for hydrogen.144,146,153 PFAS
studies have not yet directly assessed the effects of PFAS on
acetogenesis and methanogenesis.
While reductive dechlorination is the most prevalent process
in the microbial dechlorination literature, studies employing
aerobic conditions dominate the PFAS microbial biotransformation literature. Aerobic metabolic dechlorination is not
widely deployed for bioremediation, but aerobic cometabolism-based dechlorination is widely researched. If aerobic
microbial defluorination processes reflect aerobic microbial
dechlorination processes, then aerobic PFAS cometabolism
should be a significant research avenue. PFAS-cometabolism
studies are increasing and cometabolism may be a promising

avenue for PFAS defluorination breakthroughs.33,60,77,85,109,132
A review argues for the importance of PFAS biotransforming
cometabolic reactions by raising concerns about published
metabolic defluorination pathways.33 One nonmetabolic
reaction is the desulfonation of sulfur-containing precursors
under sulfur-limiting conditions, most likely through a
hydrolysis reaction without energy yield.33 As most sites
have relatively low PFAS concentrations, it is likely that PFAS
biotransforming metabolic reactions may be limited, increasing
the importance of nongrowth supporting cometabolic
reactions for PFAS biotransformation.
■FUTURE NEEDS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Much remains to be accomplished in achieving a predictable
microbial PFAS biotransformation. The literature to date,
although lacking in quantity, standardization, and anaerobic
studies, provides a direction on high-priority steps for
potentially fruitful future research. Understanding the limits
of biotransformation is constantly evolving. The identities of
microbial PFAS biotransformers and PFAS-transforming
enzymes may be found through metagenomic studies of
contaminated environments or proteomic studies of PFAS
degraders whose entire genomes have already been
sequenced.154 While enzymes for PFAS biotransformation
are not currently known, P-450-type or similar enzymes may
be able to cleave C−F bonds.23,155 In organic chemistry, F in
C−F bonds can be replaced with transition metals. Therefore,
transition-metal-dependent enzymes may release F from C−F
bonds.20,24 Additionally, mixed-function oxidases and horseradish peroxidases have been documented to be responsible for
monofluorinated compound defluorination.156,157 Identifying
PFAS-biotransformation genes and enzymes will enable the
design of applicable biotechnologies.
To achieve these needs, we recommend the following:
• Anaerobic biotransformation experiments should be
carried out with well-defined electron acceptors and
electron donors at a range of oxidation−reduction
potentials.
• Further experimentation with aerobic PFAS cometabolism is essential to assess the contribution of
cometabolism to PFAS biotransformation.
• PFAS biotransformation products should be measured,
and this endeavor may require developing new or moresensitive analytical capabilities.
• Mass and electron balances should be performed on
PFAS experiments to understand fates of F, C, and
electrons.
• A greater variety of the commercially produced PFAS
should be tested for biotransformation potential to
clarify structure-dependent biotransformation relationships.
• Microbial community structure and function should be
analyzed to identify PFAS transformers, their key
biotransformation genes, and microorganisms with
supporting roles in PFAS biotransformation.
• Experiments should evaluate hypotheses on why bacteria
may perform PFAS biotransformation reactions.
