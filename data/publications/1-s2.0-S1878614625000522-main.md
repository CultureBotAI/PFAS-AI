The large-scale manufacturing and disposal of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are causing global 
concerns, and investigations are needed to understand their ecological impacts. Saprotrophic fungi are dominant 
nutrient recyclers in ecosystems, while their roles in transforming PFAS remain largely untapped. Particularly, 
there is a lack of appropriate means to rapidly measure fluoride anions released by fungal cultures to understand 
their defluorination (deF) capacities and mechanisms. In this research, we systematically evaluated three 
prevalent means for quantifying free fluoride anions under cultural conditions of wood decay fungal species. Two 
spectrophotometric measurings, including one based on the fluoride-catalyzed kinetochromic reaction of Xylenol 
Orange-Zirconium (XO-Zr4+) and another one based on Alizarin-Lanthanum-Fluoride (Al–La3+-F-) ternary 
complexone reaction, were successfully adapted to a high-throughput micro-well setup for detecting micromolarlevel fluoride, but essential fungal media components pose significant interference to both assays. The third 
method, relying on the potentiometer and fluoride ion-selective electrode (F-ISE), demonstrated a strong ca­
pacity for anti-interferences of fungal nutrients, metabolites, and PFAS, leaving it a most appropriate method to 
study fungal deF. With F-ISE, we further demonstrated a deF test using a model PFAS, 4,4,4-trifluoro-3-(trifluor­
omethyl) crotonic acid, and a wood rot fungus Trametes versicolor. Together, our research identifies a reliable 
fluoride quantification method that can allow assessing fungal cultures for their PFAS-defluorinating phenotypes.
1. Introduction
The large-scale environmental disposal of fluorinated carbon chem­
icals, such as per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), is causing 
emerging concerns of the US EPA (United States Environmental Pro­
tection Agency) and the general public (Abunada et al., 2020). PFASs are 
the structural chemicals of widely used consumable products and fire­
fighting foams, and their inert ‘F-C’ bonds provide them with 
non-biodegradable features and make them a growing source of pollu­
tion of concern (Bentel et al., 2019; Buck et al., 2011; Wang and Liu, 
2020). Traditional management approaches are facing difficulties in 
treating these chemicals (Coggan et al., 2019; Lang et al., 2017; Liou 
et al., 2010), and as entering into the environment through landfill 
disposals and run-offs (Anderson et al., 2016; Brusseau et al., 2020; Lang 
et al., 2017), these chemicals are inevitably causing impacts on the 
ecosystem and organismal processes therein.
Saprotrophic wood decay fungi are crucial nutrient recyclers in the 
terrestrial ecosystem, and they use inherent degradative systems to 
deconstruct the polymeric structure of woody biomass to utilize the 
embedded nutrient elements that include primarily carbon but also ni­
trogen, minerals, and others (Andlar et al., 2018; Navarro et al., 2021). 
Given that the hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes they employ have 
broad substrate specificity, wood decay fungi are also found capable of 
degrading xenobiotic pollutants, such as plastics, organic dyes, and 
halogenated pharmaceuticals (Zhuo and Fan, 2021). In regard to PFAS, 
recent studies suggested that wood decay fungi may also hold the 
metabolic potential to degrade the inert fluorinated carbon structures. 
The relevant research was mainly conducted by Dr. Shaily Mahendra’s 
group (Merino et al., 2018, 2023; Tseng et al., 2014), which studied the 
degradation 
of 
6:2 
fluorotelomer 
alcohol 
[6:2 
FTOH; 
F 
(CF2)6CH2CH2OH] by several wood decay fungal species, using 
LC/MS/MS to identify the transformation products. Their research 
suggested that wood decay fungi can employ the yet-to-be-known 
biochemical pathways to transform 6:2 FTOH into a mixture of shorter

chain poly- and perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCA) [e.g., per­
fluorooctanoic (PFPeA) and perfluorooctanoic (PFHxA) acids] and other 
poly-fluoroalkyl analogs/conjugates. However, in these research, free 
fluorides were not detected; thus, it remains unclear if wood decay fungi 
can defluorinate PFAS. As the cleavage of the inert F-C bond, namely 
defluorination (deF), is recognized as a crucial step towards breaking 
down PFAS (Kucharzyk et al., 2017), being capable of quantifying the 
fluoride anions in fungal cultures would be crucial to further confirming 
the fungal potentials to degrade PFAS and to exploring fungal roles in 
responding to the emerging PFASs.
Establishing an appropriate fluoride anion-detecting method is key 
to studying the fungal deF. To date, a number of methods for the 
detection of fluoride have been explored to evaluate bacterial cultures 
for deF capacity, which include colorimetric methods such as that based 
on zirconyl xylenol orange (Cabello-Tomas and West, 1969; Harwood 
and Huyser, 1968; Macejunas, 1969) or alizarin-lanthanum complexone 
(Belcher and West, 1961a, 1961b; Bygd et al., 2022), as well as the 
methods using potentiometer [e.g., Fluoride Ion Selective Electrode 
(F-ISE)] and ion-chromatography (IC) (Huang and Jaff´e, 2019). The 
modified colorimetric approaches in micro-well plates have been 
adopted as a higher throughput means to screen large numbers of bac­
terial cultures for deF, even though they are sometimes susceptible to 
chemicals in the culture media and to reaction conditions. However, no 
fluoride-detecting tools have been made available for fungi that often 
require distinct nutrients and cultural conditions to grow.
This work, therefore, seeks to systematically evaluate and compare 
different fluoride detection methods and to adapt the most appropriate 
one to screen fungal cultures for their capacities to deF PFASs. Our re­
sults indicated that while the colorimetric approaches are both highly 
sensitive with detection limits comparable to that of F-ISE and 
compatible with 96-micro-well assays, the essential fungal media com­
ponents pose significant interference to these methods. F-ISE stood out 
as the most reliable method for detecting fungal deF. The resilience of FISE in measuring fluoride produced by fungal cultures was further 
proved by monitoring the deF of a model PFAS, 4,4,4-trifluoro-3-(tri­
fluoromethyl) crotonic acid, that has been proved as a defluorinable 
PFAS in many microbial organisms due to the electron-attracting alkenyl 
group (C=C) provokes the cleavage of adjacent C-F bond (Che et al., 
2021).
2. Materials and Methods
PFAS and fluoride chemicals PFASs and sodium fluoride were 
purchased from Sigma Aldrich [PFOA, CAS# 335-67-1, 98 % purity; 
PFOS, 1763-23-1, 98 % purity; NaF, 7681-49-4, 99.99 % purity] and 
Matrix Scientific [4,4,4-trifluoro-3-(trifluoromethyl) crotonic acid, 
1763-28-6, 97 % purity]. Stock solutions at the concentration of 10 mM 
were prepared aseptically by dissolving PFAS or sodium fluoride in 
sterilized deionized water and were stored at room temperature under 
constant agitation at 150 rpm until use. Polypropylene bottles contain­
ing the stock solutions were sonicated for 20 min and mixed prior to the 
spiking of fungal cultures.
Xylenol Orange-Zirconyl reaction The kinetochromic reaction of 
Xylenol Orange–Zirconyl (XO-Zr4+) catalyzed by fluoride ion was 
adapted from Cabello-Tomas and West (1969) and was further devel­
oped with a microwell system to improve the throughput of F−mea­
surements. To enable the reaction, a 10 mM zirconium oxychloride 
octahydrate (CAS#13520-92-8) stock solution was prepared in 12.5 mM 
hydrochloric acid (HCl) and was aged at 4 ◦C overnight prior to making 
the 500 μM Zirconyl working solution by diluting the stock solution in 
60 mM HCl. The zirconyl solutions should be aged at 4 ◦C overnight 
prior to use and must be discarded after 5 days of storage or if it becomes 
warm. The 500 μM Xylenol Orange (XO) solution was prepared by dis­
solving xylenol orange tetrasodium salt (CAS#3618-43-7) in DDI water 
and was adjusted to the pH of 4.8 with HCl. XO solution should be stable 
within 72 h. F−standards were prepared by serial dilution of a NaF stock 
solution prepared in DDI or media background dissolving the required 
amount of sodium fluoride in DDI water or in the background solutions 
of different nutrition required for fungal cultivation, and all fluoride 
solutions should be stored in polypropylene plastic (silicon-free) bottles 
to avoid concentration loss caused by the container.
A microwell XO-Zr4+ reaction procedure was optimized to determine 
the F−concentration, and the proper sequence of reagent addition was 
essential to this measurement. Specifically, to 100 μL fluoridecontaining sample, 12.5 μL XO working solution was added, followed 
by 17.5 μL of 5 M HCl. After a thorough mix, 25 μL zirconyl working 
solution was then added as uniformly quickly as possible, which was 
followed by a rapid dilution with 95 uL cold DDI water and a thorough 
mix using a multichannel pipette. While setting up the reaction, all so­
lutions should be stored on ice, and the reaction should be kept at a 
constant temperature (15–20 ◦C). After a 90-min reaction, the absor­
bance of the solution was measured at 550 nM with a VarioSkan Lux 40 
microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Resulting absorbance 
values were plotted against F−concentrations for regression analysis, 
testing the adequacy of the above method for fluoride determination. 
Spectral scanning from the wavelength of 350–620 nm was conducted to 
understand the reaction mechanisms. Notably, the reaction under cur­
rent conditions occurs rapidly and is temperature sensitive. No impact 
was observed when measuring [F-] in DDI, but a red orange precipitate 
was rapidly formed when using HMM media that prevented accurate 
fluoride quantification.
Alizarin-Lanthanum-Fluoride reaction A second colorimetric 
fluoride-determining method relying on the chelate reaction of Alizarin 
complexone, Lanthanum (III), and Fluoride ions (Al–La3+-F) was 
adapted from Belcher and West (1961b) and tested in a microwell setup. 
This method applies a principle similar to that of the commercial 
Spectroquant® Fluoride test kit and is analogous to EPA 340.3 and 
APHA 4500-F-E. To prepare the reaction, the 500 μM alizarin working 
solution was made by firstly dissolving alizarin-3-methyliminodiacetic 
acid (CAS# 3952-78-1) in DDI water aided by adding 2 N sodium hy­
droxide to ensure the complete solution of alizarin, and then by 
adjusting the final pH to about 5–6 with HCl, a process accompanied by 
the color change from violet to red. The 500 μM lanthanum solution was 
prepared by dissolving Lanthanum (III) nitrate hexahydrate (CAS# 
10277-43-7) in DDI water. Acetate buffer (pH 5.2) was prepared by 
dissolving 100 g of sodium acetate trihydrate in DDI water, followed by 
the addition of 11 mL glacial acetic acid and a final volume fixed to 1 L. 
F−
standards in the background DDI water and medium components 
were prepared as above.
The Al–La3+ working solution was freshly prepared prior to each test 
and used within 3 h, which was made by first mixing the 500 μM alizarin 
solution with acetate buffer, followed by addition of the 500 μM 
lanthanum solution, thus reaching the final concentrations of 50 μM for 
alizarin and lanthanum and 84 μM for the acetate buffer, respectively. 
To setup the microwell assay, the 100 μL fluoride-containing sample was 
mixed with 50 μL Al–La3+ working solution, and then was diluted with 
50 μL of acetone. The reaction reached its maximum sensitivity after 90 
min when the absorbance values were read at 620 nm and 530 nm with 
the VarioSkan Lux 40 microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 
a standard curve was created by plotting the 620/530 nm ratio against 
fluoride concentration. As for the XO-Zr4+ reaction, absorbance values 
of the Al–La3+-F complex were monitored by scanning a spectrum 
ranging from 360 to 700 nm to understand the reaction mechanisms.
Fluoride Ion Selective Electrode (F-ISE) measurement The 
potentiometric method for measuring fluoride ion was optimized using 
the Orion Star™ A214 pH/ISE benchtop meter (Thermo Fisher Scienti­
fic) and the Orion™ Fluoride IonPlus Sure-Flow Solid State Combination 
Electrode (CAS# 9609BNWP). Two Total Ionic Strength Adjuster Buffers 
(TISAB) were tested for their effects in eliminating the interference of 
fungal medium components. The Low-level TISAB was prepared by 
dissolving 57 mL glacial acetic acid and 58 g of NaCl in DDI water, 
adjusting the pH with 5 M NaOH to 5.0–5.5, and finally fixing the total

volume to 1 L with DDI water. TISAB II, with the CDTA and a stronger 
buffering capacity (CAS# 940909), was purchased from Thermo Fisher 
Scientific.
To measure the F−in DDI water or in the context of different medium 
components, TISAB was mixed 1:1 with the F−solution and incubated 
for 15 min at room temperature (20–25 ◦C) before analysis. F-ISE 
measurement was done according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
After calibration in storage solution for 5 min, the probe was immersed 
in F−solution for recording the millivolt (mV) reading in 5 min or until 
the reading was stable. The probe was rinsed and allowed to rest in a 
storage solution between different measurements. In this procedure, all 
solutions must be kept at the same temperature and pH (5–5.5), given 
that the electrode potentials are affected by the changes in these two 
factors. The mV readings were plotted logarithmically against F- stan­
dard concentrations for calculating the calibration curve and for deter­
mining the F- concentrations in samples.
Fungal medium Highley’s minimum medium (HMM) (Highley, 
1973) was used as the fungal medium to test its components’ influences 
on F−quantification, which contains 1 g/L glucose and 10 g/L aspen 
wood sawdust and the following basal salts additions (per liter): 
Essential nutrients mix I: 2 g NH4NO3, 2 g KH2PO4, 0.5 g MgSO4⋅7H2O, 
0.1 g CaC12⋅2H2O; Trace metal mix II: 0.57 mg H3BO4, 0.036 mg 
MnC12⋅4H2O, 0.31 mg ZnSO4⋅7H2O, 0.039 mg CuSO4⋅5H2O, 0.018 mg 
(NH4)6Mo7O24⋅4H2O, 0.015 mg FeSO4⋅7H2O; and 0.001 g thiamine 
hydrochloride.
Fungal strain and cultural conditions Wood decomposer fungal 
strain Trametes versicolor A1-ATF was obtained from Forest Mycology 
Collection at the University of Minnesota, and it was stored on YMG 
(Yeast extract 4 g/L, Malt extract 10 g/L, Glucose 10 g/L) agar slants at 
4 ◦C until being used for evaluating fluoride-quantifying methods and 
monitoring PFAS degradation. Fungal mycelia were activated on YMG 
agar plates at 28 ◦C for 6 days prior to testing their defluorination ca­
pacities with liquid culturing conditions.
Liquid cultures were conducted in replicates of five in 125 ml 
Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml of HMM medium spiked to 100 μM 
of 4,4,4-trifluoro-3-(trifluoromethyl) crotonic acid to test fungal 
defluorination. HMM was supplemented with 1 g/L glucose and 10 g/L 
aspen wood sawdust as carbon sources. Ten 5-mm activated mycelial 
plugs were used to inoculate each flask and cultured at 25 ◦C and 110 
rpm. Two milliliters of sample per flask were aliquoted and were 
centrifuged at 10, 000 rpm and 4 ◦C for collecting the supernatant for F−
quantification. The inoculated flasks without spiking PFAS or with killed 
fungus were prepared as the controls.
Fluoride detection in fungal cultures Fungal extracts collected 
from liquid cultures, as above, were measured for fluoride concentra­
tions using F-ISE. The TISABII buffer w/CDTA was mixed 1:1 with the 
extract in a 15 ml Falcon tube on the styrofoam holder and incubated for 
15 min at room temperature prior to analysis with a fluoride electrode, 
as described above.
Statistical analysis At least three bioreplicates were used in this 
work to allow the statistical analysis. Mean values and standard de­
viations were presented. Two-tailed paired t-tests were used to establish 
significant differences when required, given unequal variances among 
the various treatments. One-way ANOVA and multiple comparisons 
were used for analyses of the XO-Zr4+ and Al–La3+-F methods for 
investigating the interferences of fungal medium components. Linear 
and logarithmic regression modeling were used for calculating the F−
calibration curves of colorimetric and ISE measurements, respectively.
3. Results and Discussion
Many spectrophotometric methods for determining fluoride contents 
in community water have been developed since the 1960s 
(Cabello-Tomas and West, 1969; Harwood and Huyser, 1968; Maceju­
nas, 1969; Zolgharnein et al., 2009), and these methods are often based 
on the chelate reaction between the complexometric indicator dye and 
metal cation to form the complexone whose colors are influenced by the 
presence of more or less fluoride anions (F−). Among these, the Xylenol 
Orange-Zirconium (XO-Zr4+) and Alizarin-Lanthanum (Al–La3+) 
methods represent the well-studied ones. Here, we adapted these two 
methods in a micro-well setup for measuring F−in a high throughput 
manner and then evaluated if they are suitable for fungal deF studies by 
assessing the potential interference effects of fungal nutrients and 
PFASs.
Assessment of the Xylenol Orange-Zirconium (XO-Zr4þ) com­
plexone for the micro-well detection of fluorides. The XO-Zr4+
method is based on a kinetochromic reaction that involves the catalytic 
effect of F−on the complexation between Zirconium (IV) oxychloride 
octahydrate 
(Cl2OZr⋅8H2O) 
and 
the 
dye 
compound 
XO 
(C31H28N2Na4O13S) (Cabello-Tomas and West, 1969; Davis et al., 2011) 
(Fig. 1A). The consistent absorbance spectra of the XO-Zr4+ products in 
the absence and presence of F−reiterated the role of F−as a catalyst, as 
previously reported (Cabello-Tomas and West, 1969), rather than as a 
reactant for ternary product’s formation (Fig. 1B). With an optimized 
micro-well reaction, our results showed a hyperchromic effect of the 
red-color XO-Zr4+ complexone along with the increasing amounts of 
added F−(Fig. 1B), and this was then used on a quantitative basis for 
determining F−
concentrations. This adapted method proved to be 
reliable and allowed the detection limitation of as low as 1 μM F−in the 
context of DDI (Distilled Deionized) water, while it was significantly 
interfered with by the components of essential fungal nutrients mix (I) 
provided in the Highley’s medium (HMM) and other fungal media 
(Gruber et al., 1990; Zhang et al., 2012) (Fig. C and D). Further diagnosis 
revealed that KH2PO4, CaCl2, MgSO4, and wood sawdust are the major 
sources of interference. Among these, the high concentration of KH2PO4 
(15 mM) used in the current medium recipe significantly bleached out 
the color by preventing the formation of XO-Zr4+ complexone, and this 
is consistent with other’s findings (Cabello-Tomas and West, 1969). On 
the other hand, the 600 μM CaCl2 and 2 mM MgSO4 in the medium 
exhibited catalytic effects due to the presence of anions Cl−and SO4
2−, 
respectively, like that of fluoride. Wood sawdust also showed the cata­
lytic effect, which may be because the extractives of plant material, such 
as the phenolic compounds, could enhance the formation of XO-Zr4+
complexone. Despite the non-identified catalytic mechanism, wood 
substrate, as the main nutrient source of wood decay fungi, can pose 
significant interference to the XO-Zr4+ method for F−determination.
Assessment of the Alizarin-Lanthanum (Al–La3þ) method for 
micro-well quantification of fluorides. Different than the XO-Zr4+
method, the Al–La3+ chelate can further react with F−to form the bluepurple ternary complex (Al–La3+-F) that possesses a marked bath­
ochromic shift of the absorption wavelengths relative to the La3+-Aliz­
arin complex reactant (Fig. 2A and B). Along with the increasing amount 
of added F−, the wavelength of maximum absorption of the formed 
ternary complex will also show a hyperchromic change (Fig. 2B), of­
fering the basis for quantifying F−
in solutions. With this Al–La3+
method, as little as 1 μM F−
was accurately detected in an adapted 
micro-well setup in the solutions of DDI water (Fig. 2C), as indicated by 
the linear calibration curves over the range of 1–48 μM F−, which is 
similar to that of the XO-Zr4+ method. Notably, both methods obeyed 
the Lambert–Beer law at the tested F−range, although the calibration 
line extension did not pass through the origin point on the optical 
density axis.
The interference tests showed that the Al–La3+ method is less likely 
influenced by cationic and ionic nutrients provided in the fungal me­
dium than the XO-Zr4+ method, except KH2PO4 and wood substrate that 
were found as the major interferences suppressing the reaction of F−
with Al–La3+ chelate (Fig. 2D). KH2PO4 at the tested concentration of 
15 mM, i.e., 300- to 1500-fold excesses of added F−, completely 
bleached out the color reaction likely due to its competitive complexa­
tion with La3+, which is in line with the previous findings (Belcher and 
West, 1961a, 1961b) for a similar method based on CeriumIII-Alizarin 
complexan-Fluoride reaction. Similarly, phenolic extracts from wood

may outcompete Alizarin to chelate La3+, thereby negatively influencing 
the absorption values. However, more investigations are still required to 
understand the inhibiting mechanisms.
At this point, there might be two ways (or in combination) to 
circumvent the above-mentioned interferences: (1) Avoid the interfer­
ence nutrients and re-formulate a growth medium that is compatible 
with colorimetric fluoride measurements while still sustaining fungal 
proliferation and metabolism for defluorination. (2) Develop a masking 
agent to chelate and remove cationic interferences or an ion-exchange 
separation to eliminate interference anions, as a cleaning step prior to 
applying the colorimetric measuring. Although both can opt to satisfy 
the needs of the colorimetric determination of F−in microbial cultures 
such as bacteria (Bygd et al., 2022), these additional treatments would 
inevitably lower the throughput of the measuring. Additionally, both 
KH2PO4 and wood substrate have been shown to be essential for the 
proper growth of the wood decay fungi evaluated here, and for inducing 
the PFAS degradative capacities (Merino et al., 2023), respectively. 
Thus, changing the culturing method may not be realistic for main­
taining fungal deF capacities. In this regard, we decided to move on to 
evaluate the third fluoride-measuring method, which is based on the 
potentiometer equipped with a Fluoride Ion Selective Electrode (F-ISE), 
as discussed in the following section.

The optimized potentiometric method meets the needs of 
quantifying fluoride anions in fungal cultures. Besides colorimetric 
methods, the potentiometer is also recommended for measuring F−in 
aqueous samples with the Fluoride Ion Selective Electrode (F-ISE), as 
seen in the SW-846 Test Method 9214 of US-EPA (US EPA, 2015). 
However, it is still unknown if the F-ISE measurement would be 
impacted by fungal cultural nutrients as for the colorimetric methods.
Maintaining ionic stability is the main requirement while using F-ISE 
to quantify F−in aqueous solutions, with both protons and polyvalent 
cations such as Fe(III) can significantly vibrate potentiometer readings. 
For instance, the pH of the samples must fall into the range of 5.0–5.5 to 
allow the optimal performance of ISE, as higher proton concentrations at 
pH < 5 will facilitate the formation of HF that cannot be detected, and 
on the other hand, hydroxide ion will interfere when pH > 7. To over­
come these issues, we mixed a Total Ionic Strength Adjustment Buffer 
(TISAB; see methods for more details) with samples at a 1:1 ratio to mask 
cationic interferences and maintain pH constant. The following 
measuring then showed that the default TISAB formulation (i.e., lowlevel TISAB; Fig. 3A) was unable to equilibrate the ionic strength of 
fungal cultures and control the pH to 5.0–5.5, with significant influences 
evidenced for the Highley’s minimal media (HMM) containing variable 
carbon nutrients, while a stronger TISABII (Carey and Coleman, 2014) 
buffer containing trace CDTA [1,2-cyclohexylenedinitrilo)-tetraacetic 
Acid] can efficiently mitigate these interferences (Fig. 3B). With this 
stronger buffer, a constant pH of about 5.3 was obtained across samples 
from wood decay fungal cultures, despite that it is known that fungal 
metabolisms tend to alter environmental pH in different ways (Mali 
et al., 2017; Shimada et al., 1997). Furthermore, using this optimized 
buffering system allowed us to extend the detection limit to as low as 1 
μM F−in the presence of fungal medium components, as indicated by the 
logarithmic calibration curve in Fig. 3C.
Together, the F-ISE method evaluated here is free of interferences of 
cultural conditions required to support fungal growth and PFAS degra­
dation and offers facile measurement of F−down to 1 μM, a comparable 
level to that of the colorimetric methods. Thus, although the periodic 
calibration and the fixed time for measuring samples in a “one-by-one” 
manner can pose an obstacle for large-scale screening, the reliability and 
robustness of F-ISE still leave it the most appropriate method to study 
fungal deF.
Using the F-ISE method for deF detection in fungal cultures 
Further tests confirmed that the F-ISE measuring is free of interferences 
of the fungal metabolites produced by active growth of the white rot 
wood decay fungus T. versicolor in HMM liquid medium and of the 
context chemical of a short-carbon-chain PFCA 4,4,4-trifluoro-3-(tri­
fluoromethyl) crotonic acid (referred as “crotonic PFCA”) (Fig. 4). 
Crotonic PFCA has been proved as a defluorinable PFAS in many mi­
crobial organisms (Che et al., 2021), including wood decay fungi 
evidenced in our own research; thus, it is recognized as an ideal model 
chemical for studying fungal deF mechanisms. While this crotonic PFCA 
may not be an ideal surrogate to reflect the degradation process of 
legacy PFASs (e.g., PFOA and PFOS) that are often the focus of PFAS 
degradation studies, it represents a great model PFAS structure for 
exploring the relevant biodegradation pathways involved in fungal deF. 
Also, it is representative of short-carbon-chain carboxylic acid PFASs, 
which are an important PFAS subgroup derived from legacy PFAS 
degradation and identified as environmentally concerning pollutants 
(Brendel et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020). Relevant to this work, the use of 
crotonic PFCA is expected to facilitate the detection of fungal deF with 
the optimized F-ISE method. Using the F-ISE method, we then monitored 
the capacity of T. versicolor in defluorinating crotonic PFCA in the HMM 
liquid medium supplemented with aspen wood sawdust as the natural 
substrate, which detected 10.43 ± 1.61 μM free F−(n = 5) after 48 h of 
culture (Fig. 4). Thus, our work demonstrated that F-ISE is resilient to 
the changes of reaction conditions, including medium nutrients neces­
sary for fungal growth, fungal metabolites, and PFASs, and it can be used 
for screening fungal deF capacities.

4. Conclusions
Wood decay fungi are crucial players in nutrient recycles on terres­
trial land, while their roles in responding to and recycling the emerging 
PFAS pollutants are still understudied. Particularly, their defluorination 
capacities remain largely unknown due to the lack of a reliable, cheap 
fluoride anion-quantifying method that can allow a large-scale investi­
gation of PFAS-defluorinating phenotypes in fungal cultures. In this 
research, we systematically evaluated three F−-quantifying methods, 
including two that employ spectrophotometric measuring (i.e., XO-Zr4+
and Al–La3+) and one that relies upon a fluoride potentiometer (F-ISE), 
for their appropriateness to quantify free fluoride generated as fungal 
cultures degrade PFAS. Our results showed that both colorimetric 
methods can be adapted to the micro-well setup for large-scale assays, 
while they are significantly interfered with by nutritional elements (e.g., 
KH2PO4) required to support fungal growth and by the wood substrate 
that lures the production of fungal degradative enzyme systems (Luo 
et al., 2018; Merino et al., 2023; Steffens et al., 2023). The F-ISE, 
however, can circumvent these interferences by using an optimized 
Total Ionic Strength Adjustment Buffering system, although this may 
need 
to 
sacrifice 
sample 
processing 
throughput 
relative 
to 
micro-well-based colorimetric measuring. With the optimized F-ISE, we 
successfully demonstrated a defluorination test by using a white rot 
wood decay fungus, T. versicolor, to degrade the crotonic PFCA, which is 
a 
known 
defluorinable 
PFAS 
structure 
that 
carries 
the 
electron-attracting alkenyl group (C=C) adjacent to C-F bond.
While the use of crotonic PFCA allowed us to detect fungal deF, we 
are willing to highlight that the observed deF of this compound does not 
suggest that the structurally different longer-chain perfluoroalkyl acids 
(PFAAs), which are of greater environmental concern, would be simi­
larly degraded. Crotonic PFCA is a five-carbon branched PFAS that bears 
only certain levels of similarity to linear long-chain legacy PFAS such as 
PFOA and PFOS, and it is among those thousands of PFASs with large 
variability in structural and chemical properties. Even though, this will 
not hurt the use of crotonic PFCA to validate the F-ISE method tested 
here, and it opens new avenues for continued research to identify other 
PFAS structures susceptible to deF. Taken together, our research pro­
vided a reliable fluoride anion-quantifying approach that would facili­
tate further investigations of the deF mechanisms and eco-roles of the 
fungal organisms in PFAS-impacted environments.
