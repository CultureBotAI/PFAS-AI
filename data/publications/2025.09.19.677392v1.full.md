Abstract 
13 
 
14 
Persistent environmental pollutants demand the use of diverse microbial metabolic capabilities for 
15 
effective degradation. While naturally occurring consortia or single strains often fall short in 
16 
efficiency, synthetic microbial communities (SynComs) hold greater promise for enhanced 
17 
degradation. To address this challenge, we developed GENIA (Genomically and Environmentally 
18 
Networked Intelligent Assemblies), a genome-informed and machine learning–guided framework 
19 
for the rational design of SynComs capable of multi-pollutant degradation under simulated 
20 
environmental conditions. Using a microfluidic high-throughput cultivation platform, 2,155 
21 
bacterial strains were isolated from xenobiotic-enriched environments and screened for pollutant22 
specific growth. Whole-genome sequencing and functional annotation of 45 prioritized strains 
23 
revealed metabolic traits associated with the potential degradation of challenging persistent 
24 
environmental pollutants as proof of concept, i.e., lignin oxidation, atrazine dechlorination, and 
25 
PFAS defluorination. These genomic profiles were encoded into spline-based graph 
26 
representations and integrated within the GENIA pipeline, which combines graph neural networks, 
27 
pathway complementarity modeling, and functional redundancy minimization to predict optimal 
28 
community assemblies. The resulting nine-member community—comprising Pantoea dispersa, 
29 
Atlantibacter hermannii, Pseudomonas fulva, Paenibacillus polymyxa, Bacillus cabrialesii, 
30 
Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus pseudomycoides, Bacillus licheniformis, and Pseudomonas

32 
competition. Kinetic experiments in minimal medium demonstrated simultaneous multi-pollutant 
33 
degradation: lignin (91.6% removal by day 5), atrazine (91.4% removal by day 3), and PFOS 
34 
(93.1% removal within seven days), representing a 2-4-fold improvement over existing 
35 
approaches. GENIA establishes a scalable and generalizable framework that integrates systems36

microbial consortia with application to complex environmental bioremediation.

INTRODUCTION 
49 
 
50 
Microbial communities have shaped life on Earth not through competition, but through 
51 
cooperation, a principle captured by Lynn Margulis: "Life did not take over the globe by combat, 
52 
but by networking" (1). This ecological interdependence inspires synthetic microbial communities 
53 
(SynComs), intentionally assembled to perform functions beyond the reach of individual strains 
54 
or natural consortia. Yet, despite the conceptual appeal, few studies have validated SynCom as a 
55 
practical strategy for solving real-world environmental problems. Persistent pollutants such as 
56 
lignin, atrazine, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exemplify global environmental 
57 
challenges that demand innovative remediation approaches (2–5). These pollutants pose persistent 
58 
threats to both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems due to their structural stability and widespread 
59 
use in agriculture and industry (6–8). Atrazine, a widely used herbicide, persists in groundwater 
60 
and has been associated with endocrine disruption and ecotoxicity (9–11). Lignin, although 
61 
natural, is a complex aromatic polymer that hinders biomass valorization and requires microbial 
62 
degradation for effective bioconversion (12,13). PFAS, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) 
63 
and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), are highly fluorinated compounds used in coatings and 
64 
surfactants that resist degradation, leading to global contamination and bioaccumulation (14–16). 
65 
Microbial bioremediation has been explored as a sustainable strategy to degrade these pollutants, 
66 
leveraging specific enzymes such as peroxidases, dehalogenases, and monooxygenases (17–19). 
67 
However, most natural microbial consortia exhibit functional redundancy and competitive 
68 
interactions that limit degradation efficiency (20). Furthermore, the isolation and characterization 
69 
of novel strains with xenobiotic-degrading capabilities remain a bottleneck, particularly for 
70 
pollutants with limited bioavailability or transport across membranes (21). 
71 
 
72 
To address these limitations, high-throughput microfluidic platforms such as the Prospector® 
73 
system allow cultivation of challenging or slow-growing environmental bacteria by enabling 
74 
nanowell-scale isolation, minimizing interspecies competition, and promoting unbiased recovery 
75 
of environmental taxa (22,23). Following isolation, genome-resolved metabolic modeling can 
76 
guide rational community design by integrating genomic potential with functional performance.

Oxford Nanopore Technologies, have enhanced the resolution of biosynthetic and degradative 
79 
pathways in environmental strains (24–26). 
80 
 
81 
In parallel, machine learning (ML) and network-based modeling frameworks have shown promise 
82 
in designing SynComs for targeted functions, including biodegradation and nutrient cycling 
83 
(27,28). Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and attention-based architectures enable integration of 
84 
heterogeneous biological data, allowing predictions of emergent properties such as community 
85 
stability and pollutant degradation capacity (29–31). However, these computational approaches 
86 
are often developed independently of experimental validation, limiting their practical utility. 
87 
 
88 
Here, we present an integrated experimental-computational framework, GENIA (Genomically and 
89 
Environmentally Networked Intelligent Assemblies), that couples high-throughput strain isolation, 
90 
functional screening, genome sequencing, and network modeling to design synthetic communities 
91 
for the degradation of lignin, atrazine, and PFAS. We isolated 2,155 bacterial strains from the 
92 
cotton detritusphere—a complex, microbially active niche shaped by intensive agrochemical use 
93 
and enriched in recalcitrant compounds such as lignin (from plant biomass), atrazine (a legacy 
94 
herbicide), and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from irrigation and soil 
95 
amendments—and performed systematic phenotypic screening on defined pollutant substrates. 
96 
Genomes of the most effective degraders (n = 45) were sequenced, annotated, and analyzed for 
97 
key catabolic enzymes and transporters. 
98 
 
99 
Using spline-based genome encodings and metabolic network integration, we constructed 
100 
predictive models of community-level degradation. Functional redundancy was minimized 
101 
through Kolmogorov complexity analysis, and dynamic activation models simulated pathway 
102 
engagement under stress. Community performance was predicted using a hybrid GNN architecture 
103 
incorporating Graph Attention Networks and Node2Vec embeddings, trained on empirical growth 
104 
data. 
105 
 
106 
This study presents the first demonstration of machine learning-guided synthetic community 
107 
assembly for simultaneous degradation of structurally diverse persistent pollutants, establishing a

MATERIALS AND METHODS

113 
Overall study design. The strategy used encompassed field, lab, informatics, and in vitro 
114 
evaluation to develop and validate a minimal synthetic community for degradation of targeted 
115 
environmental pollutants: PFAS, atrazine, and lignin. First, we recovered large number of bacterial 
116 
isolates using the Prospector high throughput culturomics method, allowing us to screen for 
117 
bacteria that can utilize the pollutants of interest as a nutritional substrate, and potentially degrade 
118 
them. The bacteria identified as potential degraders were sequenced for their genomes, and our 
119 
novel GENIA strategy (Fig 1) was applied towards genome-scale models. Using a set of machine 
120 
learning strategies, we identified low-redundancy and complementary communities that can 
121 
efficiently degrade all three pollutants of interest. Finally, we validated the strategy in vitro to test 
122 
the removal of the pollutant molecules from the lab enrichments. Detailed descriptions are 
123 
presented below.  
124 
 
125 
High-throughput Culturomics in Strain Isolation Using the Prospector® System. Bacteria 
126 
were isolated from cotton stalks-associated detritusphere using the Prospector® Microbial 
127 
Isolation and Cultivation System (Isolation Bio, San Carlos, CA). The detritusphere was selected 
128 
as an isolation source due to its enrichment in lignocellulosic residues and legacy of agricultural 
129 
and industrial contaminants, including atrazine and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) (32,33). The 
130 
cotton stalks were collected from Texas A&M Brazos Bottom Experimental Farm Station 
131 
(30.551157826632647, -96.43135829477686). These stalks had been left behind after harvest in 
132 
November 2024 and were sampled for our study in April 2025. For microbial extraction, 0.5 g of 
133 
lignocellulosic material was weighed and diluted with 4.5 mL of PBS, followed by vortexing for 
134 
1 minute to detach large soil particles. Samples were then sonicated for 5 minutes at 40 kHz 
135 
frequency to dislodge microorganisms from the detritusphere. Serial dilutions of this suspension 
136 
were prepared in R2A medium using the Most Probable Number (MPN) technique with OzBlue 
137 
as a redox indicator for growth detection, MPN enabled quantification of the original microbial 
138 
concentration, which was subsequently used to calculate the appropriate dilution factor required 
139

to achieve a target density of approximately one cell per 3 nL (34). Diluted suspensions (1.5 mL) 
140 
were mixed with 1.5 mL R2A medium containing the Prospector® viability dye (final 
141 
concentration: 200 µmol L⁻¹) and loaded into arrays of >6000 nanowells (3 nL per well) using the 
142 
system's vacuum-loading chamber. Arrays were sealed and incubated aerobically at 27 °C for 48 
143 
hours. Viable isolates were identified based on fluorescence changes (excitation: 530 nm; 
144 
emission: 590 nm) and aseptically transferred to 96-well plates containing R2A broth using the 
145 
automated Prospector® transfer system (35). A total of 2,155 pure isolates were obtained. 
146 
 
147 
Functional Screening of Pollutant Degradation Potential. To assess the potential for pollutant 
148 
degradation, isolates were screened for growth using lignin, atrazine, or PFAS as primary carbon 
149 
sources in minimal medium. Analytical-grade compounds were used throughout: alkali lignin 
150 
(Sigma-Aldrich, ≥97% purity), atrazine (Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., >97% purity), 
151 
perfluorooctanesulfonic acid potassium salt (PFOS-K, Agilent Technologies, ≥98% purity), and 
152 
perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, Agilent Technologies, ≥95% purity). PFAS compounds were 
153 
supplied as stock solutions in methanol and added to achieve final concentrations of 20 mg L⁻¹ 
154 
each, with methanol content maintained below 0.04% (v/v), and control treatments with equivalent 
155 
methanol concentrations without PFAS were included to account for potential solvent utilization. 
156 
Before inoculation, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.0), 
157 
resuspended, and normalized to an optical density of OD₆₀₀ = 0.5. Automated inoculation into 96158 
well plates was performed using the Opentrons OT-2 liquid handling platform (36). Each well 
159 
received 20 µL of normalized inoculum, 180 µL of M9 minimal medium (Na₂HPO₄, 6.78 g L⁻¹; 
160 
KH₂PO₄, 3.0 g L⁻¹; NH₄Cl, 1.0 g L⁻¹; NaCl, 0.5 g L⁻¹; MgSO₄, 1 mM; CaCl₂, 0.1 mM), 
161 
supplemented with alkali lignin (500 mg L⁻¹), atrazine (30 mg L⁻¹), or PFAS (20 mg L⁻¹ each of 
162 
PFOA and PFOS) (13, 37, 38) and 5 µL OzBlue redox indicator. Cultures were incubated at 27 °C 
163 
for 10 days with orbital shaking at 120 rpm. Growth was assessed daily by measuring relative 
164 
fluorescence units (RFU) at 560 nm excitation and 590 nm emission wavelengths using a 
165 
microplate reader (SpectraMax, Molecular Devices). Isolates were considered positive for 
166 
pollutant utilization when fluorescence readings exceeded the mean fluorescence of negative 
167 
controls by at least 2 standard deviations and showed sustained growth over a minimum of 3 
168 
consecutive days. Forty-five strains demonstrating consistent growth on at least one pollutant were 
169 
selected for further analysis.

Whole-Genome Sequencing and Assembly. Genomic DNA was extracted from each isolate 
172 
using the ZymoBIOMICS DNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research, USA). High molecular weight 
173 
DNA was used to construct sequencing libraries with Oxford Nanopore standard protocols. 
174 
Sequencing was performed on the PromethION platform (Plasmidsaurus, Eugene, OR). Genome 
175 
assemblies were generated using Flye v2.9 (39), followed by three rounds of polishing with Racon 
176 
v1.4.21 (40) and one round with Medaka v1.7.2 (41). Assembly quality was assessed using 
177 
QUAST v5.2.0 (42), and completeness and contamination were evaluated with CheckM v1.2.2 
178 
(43), ensuring >98% completeness and <1.5% contamination. 
179 
 
180 
Genome Annotation and Pathway Characterization. Genome annotation was performed using 
181 
PGAP (44), Prokka v1.14.6 (45), and RAST (46). Prodigal v2.6.3 was used for gene prediction 
182 
(47). Functional annotation employed KEGG (48), COG (49), and BiGG Models database (50). 
183 
BLASTx and BLASTp were used to identify orthologs relevant to biodegradation with thresholds 
184 
of ≥70% identity, ≥70% query coverage, and E-value ≤ 1e⁻⁵ (51). Specific enzymes were identified 
185 
and classified based on their EC numbers from the functional annotation databases. Lignin186 
degrading enzymes included lignin peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.14), manganese peroxidases (EC 
187 
1.11.1.13), aryl-alcohol oxidases (EC 1.1.3.7), dye-decolorizing peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.19), and 
188 
vanillate demethylases (EC 3.1.1.68). Atrazine degradation pathways included atrazine 
189 
chlorohydrolase (EC 3.8.1.8), hydroxyatrazine ethylaminohydrolase (EC 3.5.4.43), and cyanuric 
190 
acid hydrolase (EC 3.5.2.15); the dealkylation pathway involving N-dealkylases and cytochrome 
191 
P450 enzymes (EC 1.14.14.-); and the oxidative pathway with atrazine deaminase and various 
192 
oxidoreductases (EC 1.4.99.-). Additional enzymes included melamine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.45), 
193 
ammeline aminohydrolase (EC 3.5.1.84), and ammelide aminohydrolase (EC 3.5.1.102) for 
194 
complete triazine ring mineralization. For PFAS, enzymes such as haloalkane dehalogenase (EC 
195 
3.8.1.5), alkane monooxygenases (EC 1.14.15.3), NAD(P)H oxidoreductases (EC 1.6.99.-), and 
196 
cytochrome P450s (EC 1.14.14.-) were detected. Genes encoding membrane transporters, 
197 
including ABC transporters, MFS, RND efflux pumps, and TRAP systems, were frequently 
198 
associated with atrazine and PFAS metabolism.

Community Design and Network Integration Modeling. The GENIA framework shown in Fig. 
201 
1 guided the synthetic community design. Annotated genomes were encoded using spline 
202 
transformation functions (φ) to capture non-linear associations between genomic content and 
203 
phenotype (52). Encoded profiles were processed by the pathway integration module (Ψ), which 
204 
generated composite networks by merging individual strain metabolic maps based on EC 
205 
connectivity and metabolite exchange compatibility (53–55). Functional redundancy was reduced 
206 
using entropy-based redundancy analysis (Ψʳ) via Kolmogorov complexity and Shannon entropy 
207 
(56,57). Community resilience and conditional functionality were predicted using dynamic 
208 
activation models (Ψᵃ) that simulated environmental fluctuations and substrate-limited conditions 
209 
(58,59). Graph neural network models integrating Graph Attention Networks and Node2Vec 
210 
embeddings were trained on substrate utilization data to predict community-level degradation 
211 
potential (60,61). 
212 
 
213 
Cross-Validation with INaP 2.0. To assess the predictive robustness of the GENIA-derived 
214 
community design, we conducted cross-validation using INaP 2.0 (Integrated Network and 
215 
Pathway prediction pipeline, v2.0), a complementary genome-informed platform for microbial 
216 
interaction modeling (62). INaP 2.0 integrates taxonomic, metabolic, and pathway co-occurrence 
217 
matrices to simulate cross-feeding and syntrophic dependencies among microbial pairs and 
218 
consortia. The identical 45 genomes were annotated using the INaP 2.0 pipeline, and functional 
219 
overlap with GENIA predictions was quantified by computing Jaccard similarity indices between 
220 
predicted metabolic capabilities and pollutant degradation modules. 
221 
 
222 
Experimental Validation of Synthetic Communities. Nine strains predicted by GENIA to form 
223 
an optimal community were systematically validated through controlled co-culture experiments. 
224 
Individual strains were first cultivated separately to mid-exponential phase (OD₆₀₀ = 0.8-1.0) in 
225 
M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose. Cell densities were determined by serial 
226 
dilution plating and adjusted to 9 × 10⁶ CFU mL⁻¹ for each strain. The synthetic community was 
227 
assembled by mixing equal volumes of each strain suspension in an equal ratio, resulting in a final 
228 
theoretical density of 10⁶ CFU mL⁻¹ per strain. The assembled synthetic communities were 
229 
inoculated into fresh M9 minimal medium (Na₂HPO₄, 6.78 g L⁻¹; KH₂PO₄, 3.0 g L⁻¹; NH₄Cl, 1.0 
230 
g L⁻¹; NaCl, 0.5 g L⁻¹; MgSO₄, 1 mM; CaCl₂, 0.1 mM) containing one of the three target pollutants

as the sole carbon source. Treatment conditions included kraft lignin (500 mg L⁻¹), atrazine (30 
232 
mg L⁻¹), or PFAS mixture (20 mg L⁻¹ each of PFOA and PFOS). Control treatments without 
233 
pollutants and with individual strain monocultures were included for comparative analysis. 
234 
Incubations were performed in 250 mL baffled Erlenmeyer flasks with 50 mL working volume in 
235 
6 biological replicates per treatment at 27 °C with orbital shaking at 150 rpm for 7 days. Samples 
236 
were collected every day at consistent time points (09:00 h). At each sampling point, 2 mL aliquots 
237 
were collected under aseptic conditions, where 1 mL was immediately processed for chemical 
238 
analysis and the reminder 1 mL preserved in 20% glycerol at -80°C for molecular analysis. 
239 
Atrazine and PFAS degradation were quantified by LC-MS/MS after solid-phase extraction using 
240 
C18 cartridges, employing compound-specific multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions 
241 
with deuterated internal standards to ensure analytical accuracy (63,64). Additionally, fluoride 
242 
concentrations were determined using the Hach SPADNS 2 Method 10225 with Accuvac® 
243 
ampules, following EPA-compliant procedures equivalent to EPA reference method SM 4500-F 
244 
D for drinking water and wastewater analysis (65). Lignin degradation was monitored by UV-Vis 
245 
spectrophotometry, measuring the decrease in aromatic content at 280 nm and 310 nm, with 
246 
vanillin and syringaldehyde formation quantified at their characteristic absorption maxima of 308 
247 
nm and 274 nm, respectively (66). 
248 
 
249 
Statistical Analysis and Computational Framework. Statistical analyses were conducted using 
250 
a comprehensive computational framework implemented in Python 3.11 with GPU acceleration 
251 
via CUDA 12.1. The primary machine learning framework utilized TensorFlow 2.15 with Keras 
252 
API for deep learning implementations, complemented by PyTorch 2.1 for graph neural network 
253 
architectures (67,68). Data preprocessing and traditional statistical analyses employed scikit-learn 
254 
1.4, NumPy 1.25, and SciPy 1.11 for robust numerical computations (69,70). 
255 
 
256 
Community composition differences were assessed using permutational multivariate analysis of 
257 
variance (PERMANOVA) with 10,000 permutations, implemented through the PERMANOVA-S 
258 
framework to accommodate multiple distance metrics simultaneously (71,72). Non-parametric 
259 
tests included Analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM), Multi-Response Permutation Procedures 
260 
(MRPP), and the microbiome higher criticism analysis (MiHC) for sparse association detection 
261

(73,74). Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen's d for pairwise comparisons and eta-squared 
262 
(η²) for multivariate effects. 
263 
 
264 
Model performance was evaluated using stratified k-fold cross-validation (k=10) with temporal 
265 
blocking to prevent data leakage in time-series analyses. Hyperparameter optimization employed 
266 
Bayesian optimization using Gaussian Process regression implemented in the Optuna framework 
267 
with Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) sampling (75). Model selection criteria included area 
268 
under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), F1-score, Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC), 
269 
and balanced accuracy to handle class imbalance in degradation outcomes. 
270 
 
271 
Neural network architectures were optimized using Neural Architecture Search (NAS) with 
272 
evolutionary algorithms and early stopping based on validation loss plateauing (patience=20 
273 
epochs). Regularization techniques included dropout (p=0.3), batch normalization, and L2 weight 
274 
decay (λ=0.001). Learning rate scheduling employed cosine annealing with warm restarts, and 
275 
gradient clipping prevented exploding gradients in recurrent components (76,77). 
276 
 
277 
Post-hoc power analyses were conducted using Monte Carlo simulations with 5,000 bootstrap 
278 
resamples to ensure adequate statistical power (1-β ≥ 0.80) for detecting biologically meaningful 
279 
effects. False discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied using the Benjamini-Hochberg 
280 
procedure for multiple comparisons, with a significance threshold set at α = 0.05. Effect size 
281 
interpretation followed Cohen's conventions for ecological data: small (η² = 0.01), medium (η² = 
282 
0.06), and large (η² = 0.14). 
283 
 
284 
Predictive uncertainty was quantified using Monte Carlo dropout and ensemble methods with 100 
285 
forward passes. Model interpretability employed SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values 
286 
and integrated gradients to identify feature importance in community assembly predictions (78,79). 
287 
Confidence intervals for degradation rates were calculated using bias-corrected and accelerated 
288 
(BCa) bootstrap with 2,000 resamples.

RESULTS 
298 
 
299 
The GENIA framework was developed as an integrated computational pipeline for rational design 
300 
of synthetic microbial communities capable of multi-pollutant degradation (Figure 1). The 
301 
workflow integrates high-throughput strain isolation through microfluidic cultivation, whole302 
genome sequencing and assembly, comprehensive functional annotation through multiple 
303 
pipelines, and machine learning-guided community optimization. The framework incorporates 
304 
four sequential computational modules: genomic encoding (φ) using spline transformation 
305 
functions, pathway integration (Ψ) for metabolic network merging, redundancy reduction (Ψʳ) 
306 
through entropy-based analysis, and dynamic activation models (Ψᵃ) for environmental simulation. 
307 
Machine learning components integrate Graph Neural Networks, Graph Attention Networks, and 
308 
Node2Vec embeddings to predict optimal community assemblies.

Figure 1. GENIA framework for machine learning-guided design of pollutant-degrading synthetic microbial 
312 
communities. The integrated workflow combines high-throughput isolation, Oxford Nanopore sequencing, and 
313 
comprehensive annotation (Prodigal, PGAP, Prokka, RAST) with KEGG, COG, and BiGG databases. GENIA 
314 
processes genomic data through four sequential modules: (1) Genomic Encoding (φ) using spline transformations, (2) 
315 
Pathway Integration (Ψ) for metabolic network merging, (3) Redundancy Reduction (Ψʳ) employing Kolmogorov 
316 
complexity analysis, and (4) Dynamic Activation Models (Ψᵃ) for environmental simulation. Machine learning 
317 
integration uses Graph Neural Networks and Node2Vec embeddings to predict optimal synthetic communities 
318 
targeting lignin, atrazine, and PFAS degradation pathways with enhanced capacity and minimal competition.

Functional Diversity and Phylogenomic Distribution of Biodegradation Capabilities 
321 
Comprehensive functional screening of the 45 selected strains on minimal medium containing 
322 
individual pollutants showed distinct patterns of substrate utilization and degradation potential 
323 
(Figure 2a). The hierarchical clustering analysis grouped strains based on their growth 
324 
performance across the four test conditions (M9 with addition of atrazine, M9 + lignin, M9 + 
325 
PFOS, or PFOA), showing functional clusters that transcended taxonomic boundaries. Lignin 
326 
utilization showed the broadest representation across strains, with notable performers including 
327 
Paenibacillus polymyxa (AN10, 8.80 ± 0.56 RFU), Pseudomonas pergaminensis (PSELUT1, 8.00 
328 
± 0.52 RFU), and multiple Pseudomonas species achieving 7.20 ± 0.45 RFU after 72 hours of 
329 
.

incubation. Atrazine degradation capabilities were more selective, with Pseudomonas 
330 
pergaminensis demonstrating the highest activity (3.60 ± 0.29 RFU), followed by a cluster of 
331 
strains including Bacillus pseudomycoides (AN11), Pantoea species, and most Pseudomonas 
332 
isolates showing moderate but consistent growth (2.40 ± 0.17 RFU). PFAS degradation proved 
333 
most challenging, with Pseudomonas pergaminensis again leading performance on both PFOS 
334 
(4.20 ± 0.36 RFU) and PFOA (2.52 ± 0.23 RFU). In comparison, most other Pseudomonas strains 
335 
achieved moderate PFAS utilization (3.90 ± 0.31 RFU for PFOS, 2.34 ± 0.19 RFU for PFOA). 
336 
Detailed genomic analysis showed extensive enzymatic repertoires underlying the observed 
337 
growth phenotypes (Figure 2b). The xenobiotic degradation gene count heatmap demonstrated that 
338 
diverse enzyme families supported biodegradation potential distributed heterogeneously across the 
339 
strain collection. Pseudomonas pergaminensis (PSELUT1) exhibited the most comprehensive 
340 
enzymatic profile, harboring multiple copies of lignin peroxidases (3 genes), PFAS-degrading 
341 
haloalkane dehalogenases (2 genes), and extensive transporter systems (26 total membrane 
342 
transporters). Paenibacillus polymyxa (AN10) showed exceptional lignin degradation capacity 
343 
with 5 dye-decolorizing peroxidase genes and 4 vanillate demethylase genes, correlating with its 
344 
superior lignin utilization performance. The enzyme distribution analysis revealed clear 
345 
specialization patterns across taxonomic groups. Pseudomonas species consistently possessed the 
346 
broadest enzymatic capabilities, with comprehensive PFAS degradation pathways including 
347 
multiple copies of cytochrome P450 enzymes (5-6 genes) and extensive efflux pump systems (4348 
5 genes). Bacillus strains showed strong lignin and atrazine degradation potential but notably 
349 
lacked PFAS-specific enzymes, with AN11 (B. pseudomycoides) displaying 4 dye-decolorizing 
350 
peroxidase genes but only 2 haloalkane dehalogenase genes. Microvirga species exhibited an 
351 
inverse specialization, possessing robust lignin degradation enzymes (2 lignin peroxidases, 2 
352 
manganese peroxidases) but completely lacking atrazine chlorohydrolase and hydroxyatrazine 
353 
ethylaminohydrolase genes, explaining their poor atrazine utilization phenotypes. 
354 
 
355 
Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that biodegradation capabilities were widely distributed 
356 
across bacterial families rather than being phylogenetically constrained, supporting horizontal 
357 
gene transfer as a significant evolutionary mechanism. The integration of quantitative growth data 
358 
with genomic enzyme profiles validated the GENIA framework's predictive capacity. It provided

382 
quantitatively described degradation potential and strain interactions. 
383 
 
384 
Complete Enzymatic Landscape Analysis 
385 
The detailed enzyme-level network (Figure 3a) showed quantitative distribution patterns across 
386 
the three target degradation pathways. Lignin degradation dominated the enzymatic landscape with 
387 
22 enzymes representing 47.8% of total enzymatic capacity (22/46 enzymes). NAD-dependent 
388 
DNA ligases exhibited the broadest distribution (LigA present in 8/9 strains, 88.9% coverage; 
389 
LigB in 3/9 strains, 33.3% coverage), establishing these as core-lignin-processing functions. 
390 
Multicopper oxidases (CueO) were detected in 2 strains (22.2% coverage). At the same time, 
391 
specialized lignin peroxidases (LiP, MnP) and dye-decolorizing peroxidases (DyP) were uniquely 
392 
found only in Paenibacillus polymyxa, representing 18.2% (4/22) of total lignin-degrading 
393 
enzymatic capacity. 
394 
 
395 
PFAS degradation pathways contributed 18 enzymes (39.1% of total capacity), exhibiting uniform 
396 
distribution across the consortium. Fluoride efflux transporters (CrcB) achieved near-complete 
397 
coverage (8/9 strains, 88.9%), suggesting this as the primary detoxification mechanism. Haloacid 
398 
dehalogenases showed subspecies-specific distribution with HAD variants present in 4/9 strains 
399 
(44.4% coverage), while haloalkane dehalogenase (DhlA) was exclusively detected in 
400 
Pseudomonas pergaminensis and Pseudomonas fulva, representing specialized defluorination 
401 
capability. 
402 
 
403 
Atrazine degradation represented the most constrained pathway with only 6 enzymes (13.0% of 
404 
total enzymatic capacity) distributed across 5/9 strains (55.6% coverage). Melamine deaminase 
405 
(MelA) was present in 2/9 strains (22.2% coverage), while specialized atrazine-specific enzymes 
406 
(AtzA, TrzN, AtzE, TRZ/ATZ) were distributed across 4 different strains with no overlap, 
407 
indicating pathway fragmentation and potential metabolic bottlenecks. 
408 
 
409 
Quantitative classification (Figure 3b) identified five generalist strains (55.6% of the consortium), 
410 
exhibiting capabilities across multiple degradation pathways. Paenibacillus polymyxa and 
411 
Pseudomonas pergaminensis demonstrated the highest versatility scores (3.8 each), positioning

them as central hub strains within the circular architecture. These generalist strains showed multi413 
colored capability indicators, reflecting their broad enzymatic profiles spanning all three target 
414 
pathways. Specialist strains comprised 44.4% of the consortium (4/9 strains), characterized by the 
415 
absence of atrazine degradation capabilities while maintaining both lignin and PFAS degradation 
416 
functions. Two strains were classified as lignin specialists based on higher lignin enzymatic 
417 
content (Atlantibacter hermannii with 4 lignin enzymes, Pseudomonas fulva with 3), while two 
418 
were classified as PFAS specialists based on higher PFAS enzymatic content (Bacillus 
419 
pseudomycoides and Micrococcus luteus, each with 3 PFAS enzymes). Notably, no dedicated 
420 
atrazine specialists were identified, with atrazine degradation capabilities distributed exclusively 
421 
among generalist strains, highlighting this pathway's dependence on multi-functional organisms.

contaminant bioremediation. a) Comprehensive enzyme-level metabolic network displaying all 46 identified 
426 
enzymes across nine bacterial strains. The network comprises 65 nodes (9 bacterial strains, 46 enzymes, 3 substrates, 
427 
5 intermediates, 2 products) connected by 133 directed edges. Bacterial strains are represented by large colored nodes 
428 
with associated enzyme clusters positioned around each strain. Edge colors indicate connection types: gray (strain429 
enzyme), blue (substrate-enzyme), green (enzyme-intermediate), orange (intermediate-product), and red dashed lines

(metabolic complementarity). The layout demonstrates enzymatic clustering patterns and reveals pathway-specific

connectivity, with lignin degradation showing the highest enzymatic diversity (22 enzymes), followed by PFAS 
432 
degradation (18 enzymes), and atrazine degradation (6 enzymes). b) Streamlined circular capability network

brown (lignin), green (atrazine), red (PFAS). Generalist strains (gold borders) demonstrate multi-pathway capabilities, 
437 
while specialist strains (blue borders) show pathway-specific preferences. The circular layout reveals that 55.6% of 
438 
strains are generalists capable of degrading multiple contaminants, while 44.4% are specialists lacking atrazine 
439 
degradation capabilities. Network analysis identified atrazine degradation as the primary bottleneck, with only 5/9 
440 
strains (55.6%) possessing atrazine degradation capabilities compared to complete coverage (100%) for lignin and 
441 
PFAS degradation pathways.

Metabolic Network Architecture and Cross-Validation with iNAP 2.0 
444 
Cross-validation analysis using iNAP 2.0 assessed metabolic network compatibility and functional 
445 
complementarity within the GENIA-designed synthetic consortium (Figure 4). Processing of the 
446 
identical 45 genomes through the iNAP 2.0 pipeline yielded comprehensive metabolic interaction 
447 
matrices based on KEGG pathway annotations and functional co-occurrence patterns. 
448 
 
449 
iNAP 2.0 identified 89 shared metabolic pathways (KEGG modules) across the 9-member 
450 
consortium (Figure 4a), with Jaccard similarity indices of 0.74 ± 0.09 for general metabolic 
451 
functions compared to GENIA predictions. Pathway distribution analysis revealed complete 
452 
coverage (9/9 strains) for central carbon metabolism modules (ko00010, ko00020, ko00030) and 
453 
77.8% coverage (7/9 strains) for aromatic amino acid metabolism pathways (ko00350, ko00360), 
454 
indicating a robust metabolic foundation for cooperative aromatic compound processing derived 
455 
from lignin degradation intermediates. 
456 
 
457 
Functional co-occurrence matrices identified 23 compatible metabolic modules across strain pairs. 
458 
Paenibacillus polymyxa and Pseudomonas pergaminensis exhibited maximum connectivity (12 
459 
and 11 shared modules, respectively) (Figure 4b). Cross-feeding potential analysis detected 47 
460 
exchangeable metabolite nodes, including key aromatic intermediates (vanillate, protocatechuate, 
461 
catechol) with predicted transfer coefficients ranging from 0.62 to 0.89, supporting the hub strain 
462 
classification established by the GENIA framework analysis. 
463 
 
464 
Analysis of KEGG modules associated with xenobiotic metabolism revealed heterogeneous 
465 
distribution patterns: complete aromatic compound metabolism modules (ko00362, ko00627) 
466 
were present in 6/9 strains (66.7% coverage), while halogenated compound processing modules 
467 
(ko00364) showed limited distribution (3/9 strains, 33.3% coverage) (Figure 4c). Module

completeness scores ranged from 0.43 to 0.91 across strains, with Pseudomonas pergaminensis 
469 
achieving maximum completeness (0.91) and Micrococcus luteus showing minimum coverage 
470 
(0.43) (Figure 4d). 
471 
 
472 
Comparative analysis between iNAP 2.0 interaction predictions and GENIA community design 
473 
demonstrated convergent identification of central versus peripheral strains within the metabolic 
474 
network topology. Both methods achieved 88.9% concordance (8/9 strains) in hub strain 
475 
classification, with network centrality scores correlating significantly (Pearson r = 0.78, p < 0.01). 
476 
iNAP 2.0 analysis suggests potential underutilization of Atlantibacter hermannii, which exhibited 
477 
compatible metabolic modules, but lower predicted connectivity (centrality score 0.34) compared 
478

Individual Strain Performance Variability Across Pollutant Classes 
501 
Individual strain performance validation showed distinct substrate-specific degradation 
502 
capabilities with pronounced variation across pollutant classes demonstrating clear metabolic 
503 
specialization patterns that informed consortium design. For PFOS degradation, Pseudomonas 
504 
pergaminensis achieved the highest individual performance with 41.8% removal (initial: 29.47 ± 
505 
0.91 mg L⁻¹, final: 17.16 ± 1.02 mg L⁻¹), followed by Bacillus cabrialesii with 40.3% degradation 
506 
(25.65 ± 1.89 mg L⁻¹ → 15.33 ± 0.20 mg L⁻¹) and Atlantibacter hermannii with 32.4% removal 
507 
(23.37 ± 1.13 mg L⁻¹ → 15.79 ± 0.65 mg L⁻¹). Moderate performers included Bacillus 
508 
pseudomycoides (22.3%, 23.90 ± 0.49 mg L⁻¹ → 18.59 ± 1.41 mg L⁻¹), Paenibacillus polymyxa 
509 
(18.2%, 26.22 ± 0.52 mg L⁻¹ → 21.40 ± 0.78 mg L⁻¹), and Pseudomonas fulva (17.3%, 20.43 ± 
510 
1.02 mg L⁻¹ → 16.90 ± 0.22 mg L⁻¹), while lower-tier strains showed minimal degradation: 
511 
Micrococcus luteus (12.7%), Pantoea dispersa (7.4%), and Bacillus licheniformis (3.8%) (Figure 
512 
5a). Atrazine degradation patterns revealed different strain leadership, with P. pergaminensis again 
513 
demonstrating superior performance at 62.2% removal (25.70 ± 0.50 ng mL⁻¹ → 9.70 ± 0.10 ng 
514 
mL⁻¹), followed by P. polymyxa (43.1%, 24.10 ± 0.10 ng mL⁻¹ → 13.70 ± 0.20 ng mL⁻¹) and B. 
515 
licheniformis (42.1%, 26.10 ± 0.20 ng mL⁻¹ → 15.10 ± 0.50 ng mL⁻¹). Notably, strains that 
516 
performed well on PFOS showed markedly reduced atrazine capabilities: B. cabrialesii achieved 
517 
only 11.4% atrazine degradation despite its 40.3% PFOS performance, while A. hermannii 
518 
managed just 6.2% atrazine removal compared to its 32.4% PFOS degradation. Several strains 
519 
showed negligible atrazine processing: M. luteus (6.5%), P. dispersa (2.6%), and some strains 
520 
exhibited concentration increases rather than degradation (Figure 5b). Lignin degradation revealed 
521 
yet another performance hierarchy, with P. polymyxa emerging as the clear leader with 62.7%

(4.6%), and A. hermannii (3.4%), with M. luteus showing negligible activity (0.6% degradation)

consortium consistently outperformed the best individual strains across all pollutant classes, demonstrating 2.2-fold 
541 
improvement in PFOS degradation, 1.5-fold enhancement in atrazine removal, and 1.5-fold increase in lignin

temporal progression with sequential concentration reductions: 44.9% elimination within the first 
549 
day, 82.4% by day 3, 91.6% by day 5, and final concentrations reaching 41.6 ± 1.0 mg L⁻¹, with 
550 
no substantial variations observed after day 6. This translates to a mean degradation rate of 18.3% 
551 
daily, demonstrating vigorous metabolic performance against the complex aromatic 
552 
macromolecule. UV-visible spectral analysis confirmed typical lignin absorption at 287 nm (0.950 
553 
± 0.008 absorbance units) and the generation of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives at 422 nm 
554 
through n→π electronic transitions (Fig 6a). Statistical evaluation demonstrated highly significant 
555 
variations in lignin concentrations throughout the experimental timeframe (one-way ANOVA: p 
556 
< 0.0001), validating the temporal degradation pattern. The breakdown process exhibited bi-phasic 
557 
kinetics characterized by rapid initial depolymerization, maintaining consistent enzymatic activity 
558 
during the entire experimental duration. Simultaneously, hydroxycinnamic acid formation rose 
559 
from baseline levels (0.019 ± 0.001) to maximum accumulation on day 3 (0.769 ± 0.029), 
560 
subsequently declining to 0.624 ± 0.019 by day 5, while phenolic intermediate compounds (340 
561 
nm) achieved peak concentrations of 0.201 ± 0.008 on day 3 before decreasing to 0.169 ± 0.006 
562 
by day 5, substantiating active biodegradation with intermediate metabolite formation and their 
563 
subsequent biotransformation. 
564 
 
565 
Temporal Atrazine Degradation Dynamics 
566 
The synthetic consortium exhibited rapid and extensive atrazine removal, with concentrations 
567 
declining from an initial mean of 31.825 ± 0.058 mg L⁻¹ by day 3, representing a total degradation 
568 
efficiency of 91.4% (Figure 6c). The degradation process followed a clear temporal pattern with 
569 
progressive concentration reductions: 38.7% removal by day 1 (19.500 ± 0.812 mg L⁻¹), 75.9% by 
570 
day 2 (7.675 ± 1.204 mg L⁻¹), 91.4% by day 3, and concentrations below detection limits by day 
571 
4 (<1 ng mL⁻¹). This corresponds to an average degradation rate of 30.5% per day, indicating 
572 
robust metabolic activity against the triazine herbicide. Statistical analysis revealed a highly 
573 
significant difference in atrazine concentrations across the experimental timeline (one-way 
574 
ANOVA: p < 0.0001), confirming the temporal degradation trend. Linear regression analysis of 
575 
the concentration decline yielded a strong correlation (R² = 0.969, slope = -9.905 mg L⁻¹ day⁻¹, p 
576 
= 0.0157), demonstrating consistent first-order degradation kinetics throughout the experimental 
577 
period. Control treatments maintained stable atrazine concentrations (28.750 ± 4.597 to 31.350 ± 
578

579 
were equivalent between groups (t-test, p = 0.2304), validating the experimental design. 
580 
 
581 
Temporal PFOS degradation analysis 
582 
The synthetic microbial consortium exhibited substantial PFOS degradation capabilities, with 
583 
concentration declining from an initial mean of 18.58 ± 2.85 mg L⁻¹ to achieve a remarkable 
584 
removal efficiency of 93.1% by day 7. The biodegradation process demonstrated a progressive 
585 
temporal pattern with final concentrations reaching 1.28 ± 0.04 mg L⁻¹ by day 7, indicating 
586 
sustained metabolic activity against this recalcitrant perfluorinated compound. Control samples 
587 
showed no significant concentration changes (19.61 ± 3.02 mg L⁻¹ at day 0 vs. 16.59 ± 0.95 mg 
588 
L⁻¹ at day 7; p = 0.173), confirming that observed degradation was biologically mediated rather 
589 
than due to abiotic processes (Figure 6d). The inverse relationship between PFOS degradation and 
590 
PFBS accumulation (individual sample correlations ranging from 14.77-17.33 mg L⁻¹ PFOS 
591 
decrease corresponding to 0.46-1.51 mg L⁻¹ PFBS increase) provides evidence for active 
592 
defluorination and chain-shortening mechanisms, demonstrating the consortium's capacity for 
593 
biotransformation of persistent organofluorine compounds. Concurrent fluoride liberation analysis 
594 
confirmed active C-F bond cleavage, with fluoride concentrations increasing from undetectable 
595 
baseline levels following a biphasic kinetic pattern characterized by an initial lag phase through 
596 
day 1, followed by exponential release beginning on day 2 (2.42 ± 0.32 mg L⁻¹) and reaching final 
597 
equilibrium of 22.22 ± 0.58 mg L⁻¹ by day 7. The fluoride release exhibited excellent linearity with 
598 
a rate constant of 4.257 ± 0.333 mg L⁻¹ d⁻¹ (R² = 0.9761, p = 2.16 × 10⁻⁴), providing direct 
599 
stoichiometric evidence of defluorination activity and confirming that PFOS biotransformation 
600 
involves systematic fluorine removal rather than simple adsorption or sequestration mechanisms

(Supplementary).

transformative potential extends beyond computational applications to fundamental biological 
626 
systems, where machine learning approaches are revolutionizing our ability to design functional 
627 
microbial communities for environmental remediation. 
628 
 
629 
Mechanistic Framework of Synergistic Multi-Pollutant Degradation 
630 
Our GENIA-designed consortium operates through a sophisticated metabolic cross-feeding 
631 
network that fundamentally differs from conventional single-pollutant bioremediation approaches. 
632 
The >90% PFOS, 91.6% lignin, and 91.4% atrazine removal is attributed to engineered metabolic 
633 
complementarity where degradation intermediates from one pollutant serve as co-substrates for 
634 
processing others, creating an integrated biochemical network (81). 
635 
 
636 
The consortium's lignin degradation pathway exemplifies this synergistic approach. Initial 
637 
depolymerization by lignin peroxidases (LiP, manganese peroxidases (MnP), and dye638 
decolorizing peroxidases (DyP) in Paenibacillus polymyxa and Pseudomonas pergaminensis 
639 
could yield guaiacyl (G), syringyl (S), and hydroxyphenyl (H) monomers that funnel through 
640 
vanillate and syringate intermediates (82). These aromatics undergo O-demethylation via LigM 
641 
and VanAB enzymes to generate protocatechuate and catechol, central intermediates that become 
642 
available for cross-feeding with other consortium members (83). 
643 
 
644 
For instance, the protocatechuate generated from lignin degradation enters the β-ketoadipate 
645 
pathway through protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase, yielding β-ketoadipate that ultimately 
646 
produces succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA (84). This creates a metabolic bridge where lignin-derived 
647 
carbon flows could support the energy required for PFAS and atrazine degradation by other 
648 
consortium members, potentially explaining the enhanced performance compared to strain 
649 
approaches that achieved only 27.9-67% PFOS degradation (85). 
650 
 
651 
Quantitative Analysis of Cross-Feeding Dynamics 
652 
The enzymatic landscape showed the mechanistic basis for our consortium's superior performance. 
653 
Unlike natural microbial communities where metabolite cross-feeding occurs through chance 
654 
evolutionary optimization (86), our ML-guided design deliberately positions complementary 
655 
metabolic capabilities to maximize inter-species nutrient exchange. The 22 lignin-degrading

enzymes (47.8% of total capacity) positioned across multiple strains ensure continuous production 
657 
of aromatic intermediates, while 18 PFAS-degrading enzymes (39.1%) and 6 atrazine-degrading 
658 
enzymes (13.0%) create metabolic sinks that drive the degradation network forward. 
659 
 
660 
Recent studies demonstrate that successful cross-feeding requires specific stoichiometric 
661 
relationships between metabolite producers and consumers (87). Our GENIA achieves optimal 
662 
ratios through the hub strain architecture, where Paenibacillus polymyxa and Pseudomonas 
663 
pergaminensis function as primary metabolite producers with versatility scores of 3.8 each, 
664 
supported by specialist consumers that prevent toxic intermediate accumulation. An example of 
665 
this could be conventional consortia where Rhodococcus sp. strain p52 releases catechol during 
666 
dibenzo-p-dioxin degradation, requiring Acinetobacter sp. BD6 as a dedicated detoxification 
667 
partner (88). 
668 
 
669 
Multi-Species Optimization Through Metabolic Division of Labor 
670 
The consortium's exceptional performance validates the fundamental principle that engineered 
671 
multi-species optimization transcends individual strain limitations through strategic metabolic 
672 
division of labor. This principle is demonstrated by the stark contrast between individual and 
673 
collective performance: while Pseudomonas pergaminensis achieved the highest individual PFOS 
674 
degradation (41.8%), this represents less than half the consortium's 93.1% efficiency. Individual 
675 
strains showed variable and often modest degradation capabilities across different pollutants—B. 
676 
cabrialesii achieved 40.3% PFOS degradation but only 11.4% atrazine removal, while P. 
677 
polymyxa excelled at lignin processing (62.7%) but struggled with PFOS (18.2%)—indicating 
678 
substrate-specific metabolic constraints that limit single-organism approaches. 
679 
 
680 
The consortium operates through a sophisticated division of labor where each strain assumes 
681 
leadership for different pollutant classes while contributing complementary functions across the 
682 
degradation network. P. pergaminensis serves as the primary PFAS degrader with its 
683 
comprehensive haloalkane dehalogenases and cytochrome P450 systems, P. polymyxa leads lignin 
684 
depolymerization through extensive peroxidase networks, and B. licheniformis demonstrates 
685 
specialized atrazine processing capabilities (42.1%). However, the true innovation lies in how 
686 
strains with moderate individual performance become highly efficient when their specialized

functions are coordinated: B. cabrialesii's moderate PFOS degradation (40.3%) combines 
688 
synergistically with A. hermannii's intermediate processing capabilities (32.4%), while strains like 
689 
P. dispersa provide critical community services through fluoride efflux systems that enable 
690 
sustained multi-pollutant processing impossible in single-strain systems. This multi-species 
691 
approach systematically addresses the metabolic bottlenecks that constrain individual organisms: 
692 
distributed enzymatic capacity prevents pathway saturation, specialized leadership for each 
693 
pollutant class maximizes degradation efficiency, and cross-feeding networks supply essential 
694 
cofactors where needed. The quantitative validation of this approach—with 2.2-fold improvement 
695 
in PFOS degradation, 1.5-fold enhancement in atrazine removal, and 1.5-fold increase in lignin 
696 
processing compared to best individual performers—demonstrates that coordinated moderate 
697 
performers collectively achieve superior results than any single high-performing strain, 
698 
establishing engineered metabolic cooperation as a paradigm-shifting approach where collective 
699 
metabolic intelligence emerges from rationally orchestrated strain specialization. 
700 
 
701 
Overcoming the "Forever Chemical" Challenge 
702 
The 93.1% PFOS removal achieved by the GENIA-designed consortium represents a breakthrough 
703 
in PFAS bioremediation, where conventional approaches struggle with recalcitrant C-F bonds that 
704 
give PFAS their "forever chemical" designation. This exceptional performance could be attributed 
705 
to distributed defluorination capacity across multiple strains, creating redundant pathways that 
706 
prevent metabolic bottlenecks (89). The mechanistic pathway may involve initial C-F bond 
707 
cleavage by haloalkane dehalogenases (DhlA) in Pseudomonas pergaminensis and P. fulva, 
708 
generating short-chain perfluorinated intermediates and fluoride ions (90). Direct experimental 
709 
evidence for this biotransformation pathway was provided by the systematic formation of PFBS 
710 
(C4) intermediates from PFOS (C8) degradation, with PFBS concentrations increasing from 0.54 
711 
mg L⁻¹ on day 6 to 1.40 mg L⁻¹ by day 7, demonstrating active chain-shortening mechanisms that 
712 
progressively remove fluorinated carbon units. The liberated can be immediately sequestered by 
713 
CrcB fluoride efflux transporters present in 8/9 consortium strains (88.9% coverage), preventing 
714 
fluoride toxicity that typically limits PFAS biodegradation, as confirmed by the linear fluoride 
715 
release kinetics (4.48 mg L⁻¹ final concentration, which means a defluorination percentage of 
716 
34.69%). Simultaneously, haloacid dehalogenases (HAD variants) in 4/9 strains process 
717 
intermediate metabolites, while reduced cofactors (NADPH/NADH) supply the reducing power 
718 
.

necessary for continued defluorination via enzymatic electron transfer systems, including 
719 
NAD(P)H oxidoreductases and cytochrome P450 enzymes. 
720 
 
721 
This distributed approach contrasts with single-strain systems where Pseudomonas putida 
722 
achieved only 19.0% PFOA and 46.9% PFOS transformation in 96 h (85), while Acidimicrobium 
723 
sp. strain A6 demonstrated PFOA degradation with shorter-chain perfluorinated intermediate 
724 
formation under anaerobic conditions (91). Earlier reports of Pseudomonas fluorescens D2 
725 
utilizing polyfluorinated H-PFOS as a sulfur source, though unable to transform fully saturated 
726 
PFOS (92), highlight the metabolic constraints that limit single-organism approaches compared to 
727 
the designed community's integrated defluorination network. 
728 
 
729 
Addressing the Metabolic Bottleneck 
730 
The identification of atrazine degradation as the primary metabolic bottleneck (13.0% enzymatic 
731 
capacity) reflects the complex biochemistry required for triazine ring cleavage. The designed 
732 
community addresses this through pathway distribution across five strains, employing both 
733 
hydrolytic and oxidative routes that converge on cyanuric acid as a common intermediate (93). 
734 
The hydrolytic pathway initiates with atrazine chlorohydrolase (AtzA) in Pseudomonas 
735 
pergaminensis and Bacillus pseudomycoides, converting atrazine to hydroxyatrazine through 
736 
chloride substitution. Sequential dealkylation by AtzB (hydroxyatrazine ethylaminohydrolase) and 
737 
AtzC (N-isopropylammelide isopropylaminohydrolase) yields cyanuric acid, which undergoes 
738 
ring cleavage by cyanuric acid hydrolase (AtzE) to produce ammonia and CO₂ (94). 
739 
Simultaneously, the oxidative pathway employs N-dealkylases and cytochrome P450 enzymes to 
740 
generate deethylatrazine (DEA) and deisopropylatrazine (DIA) intermediates that ultimately 
741 
converge on the cyanuric acid node. This pathway redundancy ensures robust atrazine degradation 
742 
even under varying environmental conditions, explaining the observed 91.4% removal efficiency 
743 
compared to single-strain approaches that often show variable performance due to nitrogen 
744 
catabolite repression (95). 
745 
 
746 
The complexity of atrazine metabolism highlighted in our system coincides with a recent work 
747 
from Zhang et al. (96). This work reported a similar division of labor in a four-member synthetic 
748 
community achieving 60%−99% degradation efficiency of the endogenous herbicides over 35 
749

750 
while maintaining functional complementarity. 
751 
 
752 
Integration with Central Carbon Metabolism 
753 
The innovation of the engineered consortium lies in the metabolic integration where degradation 
754 
products from all three pollutants feed into central carbon metabolism through carefully 
755 
orchestrated biochemical funneling. Lignin degradation generates protocatechuate and catechol, 
756 
which undergo ring cleavage to produce β-ketoadipate pathway intermediates including succinyl757 
CoA, acetyl-CoA, and pyruvate (97). These central metabolites provide the carbon skeletons and 
758 
energy necessary for biosynthetic processes in low-degrading consortium members. The fluoride 
759 
generated is not merely detoxified but potentially utilized for specific enzymatic functions in 
760 
fluoride-tolerant strains. Atrazine degradation yields nitrogen in the form of ammonia, supporting 
761 
amino acid biosynthesis across the consortium and relieving nitrogen limitation that commonly 
762 
constrains environmental microbial communities. 
763 
 
764 
Comparative Performance Analysis 
765 
Quantitative comparison with recent literature establishes new benchmarks for multi-pollutant 
766 
bioremediation. While recent synthetic communities achieved 98.55% imidacloprid degradation 
767 
in 15 days and 99.33% chlorantraniliprole degradation in 20 days, these studies targeted single 
768 
pesticides in isolation (96). Comparable studies on lignin degradation show efficiencies reaching 
769 
54% after 48 h under optimal conditions (97), while PFAS consortia achieve 56.7% PFOS 
770 
reduction over 20 days with external co-substrate addition (90). The simultaneous achievement of  
771 
>90% degradation across all three pollutant classes within 7 days represents a 2-4 fold 
772 
improvement in efficiency and establishes a complete paradigm shift toward integrated 
773 
environmental remediation. The temporal kinetics of lignin (bi-phasic, 91.6% by day 5), atrazine 
774 
(first-order, 91.4% by day 3), and PFOS (93.1% by day 7) demonstrate coordinated metabolic 
775 
activity that maximizes resource utilization while minimizing inhibitory intermediate 
776 
accumulation.

This study represents the first demonstration of machine learning-guided synthetic community 
780 
assembly for simultaneous degradation of structurally diverse persistent pollutants. The successful 
781 
application of Graphattention Networks and Node2Vec embeddings (27, 30) to predict optimal 
782 
microbial community assemblies represents a methodological breakthrough in synthetic biology. 
783 
Unlike recent applications focused on understanding existing community structure (98) our 
784 
GENIA framework uniquely targets predictive community design for specific functional 
785 
outcomes. The 88.9% concordance between GENIA and iNAP 2.0 predictions validates functional 
786 
relationships that transcend phylogenetic boundaries, representing a significant advance over 
787 
metabolic modeling approaches requiring extensive manual curation (99, 100). Our framework 
788 
automates metabolic complementarity identification and predicts community stability under 
789 
perturbation, enabling rational biological system design with unprecedented precision. 
790 
 
791 
Environmental and Economic Implications 
792 
The demonstration of simultaneous multi-pollutant degradation addresses critical gaps in 
793 
environmental biotechnology where contaminated sites contain complex pollutant mixtures 
794 
requiring costly sequential treatments (101). As regulatory pressure increases for comprehensive 
795 
environmental remediation, particularly for persistent pollutants like PFAS (8), engineered 
796 
communities with defined functional capabilities become increasingly valuable for both 
797 
remediation and prevention strategies. The framework's modularity presented here enables 
798 
expansion to additional pollutant classes, providing a scalable platform for addressing emerging 
799 
contaminant challenges (93). 
800 
 
801 
The GENIA framework establishes a proof-of-concept for machine learning-guided design of 
802 
synthetic microbial communities, demonstrating for the first time that computational approaches 
803 
can successfully predict and engineer biological systems for complex environmental applications. 
804 
As machine learning continues to revolutionize biological sciences, our approach exemplifies how 
805 
artificial intelligence can capture biological intuition to design functional microbial consortia. 
806 
These consortia possess emergent properties exceeding those of individual strains or natural 
807 
communities, opening new avenues for addressing global environmental challenges through 
808 
engineered biological solutions.
