Abstract
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are emerging
contaminants of concern due to their health effects and persistence
in the environment. Although perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), such as
perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid
(PFOS) are very difficult to biodegrade because they are completely
saturated with fluorine, it has recently been shown that
Acidimicrobium Sp. A6 (A6), which oxidizes ammonium under iron
reducing conditions (Feammox process), can defluorinate PFAAs.  A
kinetic model was developed and tested in this study using
laboratory batch incubation experiments to couple the Feammox
process to PFAS defluorination. The experimental results show
higher Feammox activity and PFAS degradation in A6 enrichment
cultures than in pure A6 cultures. The coupled experimental and
modeling results show that the PFAS defluorination rate is
proportional to the rate of ammonium oxidation.  The ammonium
oxidation rate and the defluorination rate increase monotonically,
but not linearly, with increasing A6 biomass. Given that different
batches of A6 cultures have different level of Feammox activity, the
parameters required to simulate the Feammox experiments varied
between A6 batches, whereas parameters required to link the
Feammox process to PFAS defluorination remained relatively
constant between A6 batches.
Keywords: Feammox, Acidimicrobium sp. Strain A6, kinetic
modeling, defluorination, PFAS.
