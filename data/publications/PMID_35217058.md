Abstract
Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid
(PFOA) are highly recalcitrant anthropogenic chemicals that are
ubiquitously present in the environment and are harmful to
humans. Typical water and wastewater treatment processes
(coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration) are proven
to be largely ineffective, while adsorption with granular activated
carbon (GAC) has been the chief option to capture them from
aqueous sources followed by incineration. However, this process is
time-consuming, and produces additional solid waste and air
pollution. Treatment methods for PFOS and PFOA generally follow
two routes: (1) removal from source and reduce the risk; (2)
degradation. Emerging technologies focusing on degradation are

critically reviewed in this contribution. Various processes such as
bioremediation, electrocoagulation, foam fractionation, sonolysis,
photocatalysis, mechanochemical, electrochemical degradation,
beams of electron and plasma have been developed and studied in
the past decade to address PFAS crisis. The underlying mechanisms
of these PFAS degradation methods have been categorized. Two
main challenges have been identified, namely complexity in large
scale operation and the release of toxic byproducts. Based on the
literature survey, we have provided a strength-weaknessopportunity-threat (SWOT) analysis and quantitative rating on their
efficiency, environmental impact and technology readiness.
Keywords: Literature review; PFAA treatment technologies; PFAS
degradation; PFAS removal; PFOA; PFOS; Quantitative rating;
SWOT analysis.
