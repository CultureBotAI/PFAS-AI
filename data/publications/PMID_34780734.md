Abstract
Perfluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds (PFASs) are a class
of synthetic chemical substances that are widely used in human

production and life, such as fire-fighting foams, textiles and
clothing, surfactants, and surface protective agents. Perfluorooctane
sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are the
most abundant and common perfluorinated compounds in biota and
humans. Currently, PFOA and PFOS have been listed in the
Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, and their
production has been halted in many countries. However, because
the high-energy carbon-fluorine bond can make it resistant to
hydrolysis, photolysis, microbial degradation, and vertebrate
metabolism, PFOA and PFOS show environmental persistence and
bioaccumulation and hence, are of great concern to humans and
wildlife. PFOA and PFOS have toxic effects on the immune system
of the body. This article reviewed the effects of PFOA and PFOS on
immune organs such as the spleen, bone marrow, and thymus of
mice and zebrafish, and the effects on non-specific immune
functions such as the skin barrier, intestinal mucosal barrier, and
humoral immunity. We also reviewed the influence of specific
immune functions based on cellular immunity, and further
summarized the possible immune toxicity mechanisms such as
AIM2 inflammasome activation, gene dysregulation, and signal
pathway disorders caused by PFOA and PFOS. The aim of this
review was to provide a reference for further understanding of the
immunotoxicity and the responsible mechanism of PFOA and PFOS.
Keywords: Immune function; Immunotoxicity; Mechanism; PFOA;
PFOS.
