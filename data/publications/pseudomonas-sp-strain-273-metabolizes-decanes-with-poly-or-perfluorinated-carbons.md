ABSTRACT: During growth with terminally monofluorinated
decanes, the soil isolate Pseudomonas sp. strain 273 releases
inorganic fluoride and channels fluorometabolites into glycerophospholipid biosynthesis. We explored the ability of this bacterium to
metabolize 1,1-difluorodecane (F2-decane), 1,1,1-trifluorodecane
(F3-decane), and 1,1,1,2,2-pentafluorodecane (F5-decane) to assess
the impacts of increasing degree of fluorination on organismal
metabolism. Growth occurred with all three polyfluorodecane
substrates, and inorganic fluoride release was observed in cultures
amended with F2-decane and F5-decane but not with F3-decane.
Fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (19F NMR)
detected polyfluorinated C6 and C4 short-chain fatty acid catabolites
suggesting incomplete β-oxidation during catabolism by strain 273.
Gas chromatography−mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis corroborated the formation of terminally poly- or perfluorinated shortchain fatty acids. Ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) based global
lipidome profiling revealed glycerophospholipids with fluorine substitutions at the sn1/sn2 acyl chains and identified a range of
glycerophospholipids that contained between two and ten fluorines depending on the growth substrate. These findings advance our
understanding of bacterial transformation of alkanes with poly- and perfluorinated carbons and highlight the formation of short-chain
fluorinated fatty acids as catabloc products and fluorophospholipids as anabolic products.

■INTRODUCTION
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are recalcitrant,
inert, and applied broadly in many sectors. PFASs have become
globally distributed, and there is concern that some congeners
may impact environmental and human health.1−5 The strength
of the C−F bond was used to explain poor microbial
biodegradability of PFASs;6 however, microbial enzymes have
been demonstrated to break C−F bonds at room temperature
and neutral pH.7−12 More likely, the observed recalcitrance is
attributed to the occurrence of multiple C−F bonds on the same
molecule, and the xenobiotic nature of organic compounds with
poly- and perfluorinated carbons.13,14 Many PFASs possess
functional groups as an entry point for transformation reactions
that can result in the elimination of fluorine in the form of
inorganic fluoride.6
The soil bacterium Pseudomonas sp. strain 273 metabolizes
terminally monofluorinated medium-chain length alkanes with
concomitant release of inorganic fluoride.15 A novel type of
alkane monooxygenase (AlkB) system attacks the terminally
fluorinated carbon to form an unstable geminal halohydrin that
eliminates fluoride to form an aldehyde that is subsequently
oxidized to a carboxylate.16,17 If the initial oxidation occurs on
the nonfluorinated terminus, or if the substrate bears fluorines at
both termini, monofluorinated fatty acids are produced.15,18 The
catabolism of monofluorinated fatty acids generates fluorinated
intermediates that can enter anabolic pathways resulting in the
synthesis of fluorinated glycerophospholipids that are incorporated into membrane structures (e.g., the membrane bilayer) of
strain 273.18
This study investigates the ability of Pseudomonas sp. strain
273 to metabolize polyfluorinated decanes and explores
fluoromembrane formation in response to increasing levels of
fluorination at one terminal end of the decane substrate. Growth
studies demonstrate that Pseudomonas sp. strain 273 utilizes ndecanes with terminal −CF2H, −CF3, and −CF2−CF3 groups as

growth substrates under oxic conditions. The integrated
application of
19F NMR, ultrahigh performance liquid
chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLCHRMS), UHPLC-MS/HRMS, gas chromatography-MS (GCMS), and fluoride ion selective electrode analysis identified
transformation products and revealed catabolic pathways for F2decane, F3-decane, and F5-decane, and demonstrated variation
in organofluorine incorporation into different glycerophospholipid classes based on the degree of fluorination of the growth
substrate.
■MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals. 1,1-Difluorodecane (F2-decane, purity >97%),
1,1,1-trifluorodecane (F3-decane, purity >96%), 1,1,1,2,2pentafluorodecane (F5-decane, purity >97%), 4,4-difluorobutanoic acid (purity >97%) and 5,5,6,6,6-pentafluorohexanoic acid
(purity >97%) were obtained from SynQuest Laboratories, Inc.
(Alachua, FL, USA). Decanoic acid (purity >99.5%), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (purity >99%), potassium fluoride (purity
>99%), n-decane (decane) (purity >99%), sodium 4,4,4trifluorobutanoate (F3-butanoate, purity >97%), 6,6,6-trifluorohexanoic acid (purity >95%) standards, and hexanes (purity
>97%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,
USA). Glycerophospholipid standards (SPLASH LIPIDOMIX
Mass Spec Standard, 330707) were obtained from Avanti Polar
Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL, USA). Ethanol (purity >99.5%),
diethyl ether (purity >99%), pyridine (purity >99%), n-propanol
(purity > (99.9%), propyl chloroformate (purity >98%),
ammonium hydroxide and methanol (purity >99.8%) were
obtained from Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). All other
chemicals used were analytical reagent grade or higher, unless
otherwise specified. All decanes were unbranched n-decanes. All
substrates were confirmed to be free of fluorinated impurities by
19F NMR before incubation with strain 273, and initial 19F NMR
spectra collected from newly established incubations also did
not detect any fluoride or fluorinated impurities.
Growth Conditions of Pseudomonas sp. Strain 273.
Strain 273 was grown in defined phosphate-buffered (pH 7.3)
mineral salt medium.15 To test growth with different
polyfluorinated decanes, strain 273 was grown for two
consecutive transfers with 7 mM decanoate added gravimetrically, before fresh medium vessels received 0.5% (v/v) of a strain
273 suspension with an optical density (OD600 nm) of l.0 as
inoculum. The fresh medium contained 7 mM (nominal) of a
fluorinated decane or decane. Liquid alkanes were added
gravimetrically using a glass microsyringe. For lipidomic
measurements, cultures were grown in 50 mL baffled
Erlenmeyer flasks (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing 10
mL of medium and sealed with rubber stoppers (Supelco;
Stockbridge, GA, USA) held in place with tape. Quintuplet
vessels were pressurized with 1.5 atm of air to provide oxygen as
electron acceptor. Incubation occurred at 30 °C in the upright
position at 120 rpm. Cultures grown with F2-deane, F3-decane,
and F5-decane were harvested for lipid extraction following
complete consumption of the fluorodecane substrate based on
GC-MS measurements (12-h incubation for F3-decane and F5decane; 20-h incubation for F2-decane). To determine mass
balances, strain 273 was grown in quintuplet sealed 160 mL glass
serum bottles containing 10 mL of medium that received 7 mM
(nominal) of a polyfluorodecane under an air headspace of 2
atm. The cultures were incubated for 4 days (F2-decane/F3decane/F5-decane) and 14 days (F5-decane +10 mM
decanoate) prior to quantitative analysis of substrates and
products.
■ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES
Quantification of Growth Substrates and Fluorinated
Short-Chain Fatty Acids. Analysis of short chain fatty acids
and growth substrates was performed using an Agilent 5977 GC
coupled to a mass-selective detector equipped with an Agilent
HP-5MS Ultra Inert 30 m x 250 μm x 0.25 μm column (Santa
Clara, CA) (Supporting Methods; SI). Quantification of initial
substrate concentrations was performed via hexanes extraction
of 1 mL culture suspension samples collected immediately after
inoculation and vigorous agitation. External standard curves
were prepared by mixing different volumes of F2-decane, F3decane, or F5-decane with hexanes to obtain a concentration of
∼7 mM, with a range of starting concentrations between 7.02 ±
0.08 to 7.79 ± 0.08 mM. These stock solutions underwent a
series of half log dilutions (∼7 mM −0.07 mM) in hexanes to
generate standard curves covering the desired concentration
ranges.19 No measurements in this study had a peak with a
signal-to-noise ratio <3:1. Therefore, the limit of detection
(LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) were assumed to
be the lowest concentrations from the calibration data, which
averaged ∼0.073 mM. Quantification of fluorinated short-chain
fatty acids followed an established derivatization procedure.20
Briefly, cultivation vessels were placed in −80 °C for 5 min to
condense all volatile compounds. One mL culture suspension
samples were withdrawn from the cultivation vessels (five
replicates per growth substrate), mixed with 250 μL n-propanol/
pyridine (3:2, v:v) solution in 2 mL plastic Eppendorf tubes,
followed by the addition of 50 μL propyl chloroformate. The
tubes were vortexed briefly and vented, followed by a 30-s
treatment in an ultrasonic water bath. Hexanes (300 μL) was
added to each tube, immediately vortexed, and centrifuged at
3,000 x g for 3 min at room temperature. The top layers (∼300
μL) were transferred to 300 μL glass autosampler vials, which
were closed and stored at 4 °C until analysis. Abiotic control
incubations without inocula (three replicates per substrate),
each containing 7 mM of potential fluorinated short-chain fatty
acid transformation products (i.e., F2-butanoate, F3-butanoate,
and F5-hexanoate), were incubated alongside live cultures to
assess abiotic losses and generate external standard curves (7
mM −0.086 mM) for short-chain fatty acid quantification21,22
(Figures S1 and S2). Additional information regarding the
quantification of short-chain fatty acids and initial substrates can
be found in SI Figures S1 and S2 and Tables S1−S4.
19F NMR Spectroscopy. NMR spectra were acquired with a
Varian VNMRS 470 MHz (Palo Alto, CA, USA) and a Bruker
Avance NEO 470 MHz (Billerica, MA, USA) nuclear magnetic
resonance spectrometers. The Varian was equipped with a
OneNMR probe (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) channeled to
fluorine, and the Bruker was fitted with a Broad Band probe to
observe fluorine. A limit of detection of 5 μM (∼0.1 mg L−1)
inorganic fluoride was established using a maximum of 1,000
scans. The spectra produced in this investigation were fluorineproton coupled and fluorine−fluorine coupled. The 5 mm
diameter NMR tube (CortecNet, Brooklyn, NY, USA)
containing a 1 mM sodium trifluoroacetate (TFA) internal
standard dissolved in deuterium oxide (Cambridge Isotope
Laboratories, Tewksbury, MA, USA) was placed within a glass
capillary and sealed at both ends. For 19F NMR analysis, 10 mL
cultures were grown in 50 mL baffled Erlenmeyer flasks with the
respective polyfluorinated decane (7 mM, nominal). For 19F

NMR analysis, 800 μL of culture suspension was transferred to
the NMR tube followed by the insertion of a 1 mM TFA internal
standard sealed within a separate glass capillary. Scans were
collected from samples taken immediately after inoculation,
after 4 days (F2-decane, F3-decane, and F5-decane), and after
14 days (F5-decane + decanoate) of incubation. Whole cell 19F
NMR was performed to determine consumption of fluoroalkane
substrates, assess defluorination (i.e., formation of inorganic
fluoride), and to identify fluorinated metabolites. Full 19F NMR
spectra were collected from δ + 20 to −200 ppm and can be
found in the SI (Figures SA1−SA28). Spectra of unknown
compounds were matched to authentic standards (unless
unavailable) with further identity confirmation using GC-MS
(Figure S3). Abiotic control incubations without inocula
(triplicates per substrate), each containing 7 mM of substrate
(F2-decane, F3-butanoate, F5-hexanoate, or F5-decane), were
incubated alongside live cultures to assess abiotic losses (Figure
S4).
Fluoride Measurements. Inorganic fluoride concentrations were calculated using data obtained from 19F NMR [eqs
1−3 (SI)]. In addition, fluoride was quantified with an Orion
Star A214 benchtop meter equipped with a fluoride ion-selective
electrode (FISE) (IonPlus SureFlow 9609BNWP). An external
standard curve was generated with a series of potassium fluoride
solutions (half log dilutions; 7 mM −0.01 mM) following the
electrode manufacturer’s guidelines. Concentrations were
determined using eqs 4 and 5 (SI) and are shown in Figures
S5 and S6 and Table S6.
Quantitative PCR (qPCR). For enumeration of strain 273
cells, 1 mL culture suspension aliquots were passed through 0.22
μM polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filters (Merck
Millipore Ltd., Burlington, MA, USA). Genomic DNA was
extracted from the cells captured on the filters using the DNeasy
PowerLyzer PowerSoil kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). SYBR
Green-based qPCR followed an established protocol using
primers (5′-3′) F-GCTAGTCTAACCTTCGGGGG (Tm = 59
°C) and R-TCCCCTACGGCTACCTTGTT (Tm = 60 °C)
targeting a consensus region of the five 16S rRNA genes of strain
273.18,23 Strain 273 possesses five 16S rRNA genes per genome,
and cell abundances were calculated by dividing the 16S rRNA
gene copy numbers by a factor of 5.24
Chromatographic Methods for Glycerophospholipid
Measurements. For the analysis of cellular glycerophospholipids, a two-pronged approach was applied involving hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) (Method
H),25,26 and reversed-phase (RP) chromatography (Method
RP).27 Method H achieves global lipidome profiling and
identifies fluorinated glycerophospholipids through separation
via headgroup to match retention times. Method RP also
achieves global lipidome profiling, but also generates information about sn1/sn2 glycerophospholipid acyl chain fragmentation signatures.28 See SI for detailed protocol for glycerophospholipid extraction.
Data Analysis. Nonfluorinated glycerophospholipids were
annotated using a library of formulae that allowed for 6−46
carbons in the fatty acyl tails and up to 10 degrees of
unsaturation among the two tails. At least one standard for
each major phospholipid class was used in the analyses, and
structures were further validated with fragmentation when
available. Fluorinated glycerophospholipids were annotated
using a custom library comprising all possible formulae above
with 1 to 10 fluorine substitutions added, retention time matches
to the respective nonfluorinated internal standards (± 0.5 min),
and mass accuracies (± 5 ppm) of the expected m/z values. The
structure of annotated fluorinated glycerophospholipids were
further validated using fragmentation data when available. Since
standards of fluorinated glycerophospholipids are not available,
retention times of these analytes were estimated based on those
observed for the respective nonfluorinated analogs operated
using Method H on an Orbitrap Exploris 120. A total
glycerophospholipid detected (%) figure was constructed by
summing individual concentrations of detected glycerophospholipids by specific categories and presenting respective
glycerophospholipid classes as a percentage of total ions
detected. Glycerophospholipid abundances were determined
by summation of the relative concentrations by comparison to
the Avanti deuterated internal standard. A heatmap was
developed that summed fluorinated species and nonfluorinated
species and calculated the ratio of normalized, log2 transformed
intensities of F2-decane, F3-decane, and F5-decane-grown cells
over decane grown-cells and clustered using RStudio
(V2024.12.1) (Posit Software, PBC, Boston, MA, http://
www.posit.co/). A paired student’s t-test was utilized to
determine significance and calculate p-values. Relative concentration estimates of fluorinated glycerophospholipids assumed
that fluorinated glycerophospholipids and their nonfluorinated
counterparts had the same ionization efficiency, resulting in
comparable peak areas and signal intensities. Abundance data
represent the averages of five biological replicates. The mass
spectra and extracted io chromatograms were plotted using
XCalibur software version 4.2 SP1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Additional information regarding UHPLC-HRMS methods and
specific parameters can be found in the Supporting Methods in

■RESULTS
Pseudomonas sp. Strain 273 Catabolizes n-Decanes
Carrying Poly- or Perfluorinated Carbon Atoms. Pseudomonas sp. strain 273 grew with F2-decane, F3-decane, or F5decane under oxic conditions as determined by substrate
consumption, formation of fluorinated catabolites, and increase
in cell density (determined with qPCR, Table S5). After a 4-day
incubation, strain 273 consumed 7.15 ± 0.17 mM F2-decane or
7.53 ± 0.72 mM F3-decane to below detectable levels,
generating 6.39 ± 0.19 mM F2-butanoate or 6.13 ± 0.28 mM
F3-butanoate, respectively, as a major catabolite (Figure 1A, B).
During growth with F2-decane, 0.17 ± 0.04 mM inorganic
fluoride was released (Figure 1A) indicating some C−F bond
cleavage; however, fluoride release was not apparent with F3decane as a growth substrate (Figure 1B, Table S6). Cultures
that received 7.00 ± 0.21 mM F5-decane produced 0.48 ± 0.28
mM F5-hexanoate as the only catabolite detected without
measurable fluoride release (Figure 1C). Interestingly, fluoride
release was observed in strain 273 cultures amended with F5decane and decanoate as additional growth substrate. Following
an extended 14-day incubation, cultures with 7.08 ± 0.14 mM
F5-decane and 10 mM decanoate generated 1.44 ± 0.47 mM F3butanoate and 0.226 ± 0.132 mM F5-hexanoate associated with
the release of 2.72 ± 0.91 mM fluoride (Figure 1D). No growth
or fluoride release occurred in abiotic controls with carbon
substrate and no inoculum or vessels with inoculum and no
carbon substrate (Figure S4, Tables S6 and S7).

obtain more information about the catabolites formed, 19F NMR

The 19F NMR data shown in Figure 2A display the initial
conditions with 7 mM (nominal) F2-decane (δ −117.4 ppm).
Following a 4-day incubation, 19F NMR revealed a shift of δ 0.2
ppm from F2-decane indicative of the formation of F2butanoate (δ −117.6 ppm, Figure 2B) (Figures S3 and S4).
19F NMR confirmed the FISE measurements and detected the
release of inorganic fluoride in F2-decane-grown cultures (Table
S7). A 4-day incubation of F3-decane-grown strain 273 cells
revealed a shift of δ 1.3 ppm from the F3-decane substrate (δ
−68.8 ppm, triplet), indicating F3-butanoate (δ −67.5 ppm)
formation (Figure 2C,D). 19F NMR did not detect fluoride in
F3-decane-grown cells demonstrating no C−F bond cleavage
occurred (Figure 2D, Figures S3 and S4). Cells grown with F5decane and decanoate produced F5-hexanoate and F3butanoate, as confirmed with 19F NMR (Figures S3 and S4).
The use of 19F NMR detected inorganic fluoride (δ −120.2 ppm,
singlet) (Figure 2F, Figures S3 and S4 and Table S7). 19F NMR
performed on strain 273 cultures grown with F5-decane and
decanoate identified several organofluorine catabolites in low
abundances (Figure 2F). Notably, a peak detected as a triplet (δ
−66.9 ppm) was similar in chemical shift to 6,6,6-trifluorohexanoate (F3-hexanoate: δ −66.8 ppm) based on comparison to
an authentic external standard (Figure S3) and separated by δ
0.10 ppm. The molecule has been annotated as 6,6,6-trifluoro-3oxohexanoate since the shift matches that expected from a
carbonyl three carbons away from the terminal carboxylate.
Quantification of F2-butanoate and F3-butanoate with
19F
NMR was lower than expected presumably due to loss of volatile
polyfluorinated butyric acids during transfer of live culture
suspensions into the NMR tubes. Alkyl carboxylic acid have
been shown to form azeotropes with water and alcohols,29 and
fluorination is known to lower the boiling points of molecules.30
The NMR analysis of cultures amended with F5-decane did not
detect this molecule following a 4-day (Figure 2F) and 14-day
(Figure 2H) incubation due to consumption, presumed
volatility, (Figures S7 and S8), and/or poor solubility (i.e., a
separate, immiscible nonaqueous phase liquid [NAPL] phase
was observed following the 4- and 14-day incubation periods) of
this compound.
Product(s) of F5-Decane Catabolism. When strain 273
culturs were amended with F5-decane as the sole substrate, F5hexanoate was the only detectable catabolite during a 4-day
incubation (Figure 1C). When F5-decane was coamended with
decanoate, F5-hexanoate plus two additional fluorinated
products, F3-butanoate and fluoride were detected (Figure
1D). Assuming F5-hexanoate is the precursor to F3-butanoate,
the loss of the methylene fluorines (−CF2−) of F5-hexanoate
(δ-carbon) can occur via two HF eliminations resulting in the βoxidation intermediate 6,6,6-trifluoro-3-oxohexanoate. Such a
reaction would lead to a 2:1 mixture of fluoride:F3-hexanoate
(Figure 1D). To determine if F5-hexanoate was the substrate for
defluorination and a precursor of F3-butanoate, strain 273
cultures were grown with 10 mM decanoate in the presence of
7.16 ± 0.160 mM F5-hexanoate. Fluoride release and F3butanoate production were observed in these cultures (Figure
3B, Table S7) consistent with the postulated reaction sequence.
Notably,

percent recovery of 96.0 ± 2.9% (Panel A). Growth with F3-decane
resulted in the formation of F3-butanoate and no fluoride release after 4
days with a percent recovery of 98.4 ± 3.1% (Panel B). Growth with F5decane resulted in F5-hexanoate formation but no fluoride release after
4 days with a percent recovery of 76.2 ± 3.7% (Panel C). The addition
of decanoate stimulated F5-decane degradation and resulted in the
production of inorganic fluoride and F3-butanoate in a ratio of ∼2:1
(Panel D) with a percent recovery of 82.7 ± 8.5%. Initial (t0) recoveries
of substrates, recoveries of polyfluorinated catabolites and fluoride after
specified incubation periods (t1, 4 or 14 days), and cell densities are
shown in Figures S1, S2, and S6 and Tables S1−S7. As the detected
molecules contained differing numbers of F, the mol of F contained in
each organic or inorganic species was determined by multiplying the
concentration of each substrate and transformation product by the
number of fluorines in the respective molecules to facilitate accurate
flouride and organic fluoride recovery (F Recovery) calculations.
Therefore, total F Recovery for each experimental condition was
calculated using the following formula: F Recovery Percentage =

hexanoate + decanoate detected a peak (δ −66.9 ppm, triplet),
which was also observed in cell suspensions grown with F5decane + decanoate. To determine if F3-hexanoate was a
substrate for β-oxidation and a precursor of F3-butanoate, strain
273 cultures were grown with 1 mM F3-hexanoate (Figure 3C).
The 19F NMR analysis of cultures that received F3-hexanoate as
the sole carbon substrate identified F3-butanoate (δ −67.5 ppm,
triplet) as catabolic product following a 60-day incubation.
These experiments suggest that F5-decane is converted to F5hexanoate via two subsequent β-oxidation cycles. F5-hexanoate
then undergoes defluorination at the perfluorinated δ-carbon
(−CF2−) to generate a structure similar to F3-hexanoate, which
19F NMR analysis tentatively identified as 6,6,6-trifluoro-3oxohexanoate based on the chemical shift. One additional cycle
of β-oxidation would yield F3-butanoate. Taken together, these
findings illustrate the capability of strain 273 to defluorinate the
perfluorinated δ-carbon (−CF2−) of F5-hexanoate, resulting in
the formation of F3-butanoate and inorganic fluoride.
Detection and Identification of Fluorinated Glycerophospholipids. Utilizing Method H, polyfluorinated glycerFigure 2. 19F NMR analysis of strain 273 live culture suspensions amended with F2-decane, F3-decane, F5-decane, or F5-decane + decanoate

Panel B shows the formation of F2-butanoate (δ −117.6 ppm) after a 4-day incubation. Panel C shows t0 for cells grown with F3-decane (δ −68.8

with F5-decane. Panel G shows the t0 spectrum for cultures that received F5-decane + decanoate-grown cultures (δ −88.1 singlet, −120.7 triplet ppm).
Panel H depicts both identified and unidentified fluorinated catabolites following a 14-day incubation period with F5-decane + decanoate. All named
compounds were identified based on comparisons to authentic external standards (Figure S3). Quantification via the 1 mM TFA internal standard
revealed no more than 2.78 ± 0.910 mM inorganic fluoride release that coincided with 1.44 ± 0.470 mM F3-butanoate formation in F5-decane +
decanoate-grown cultures (Table S7). Quantification of solutes was performed using eqs 1−5 (SI). Control incubations containing F2-decane, F3decane, or F5-decane demonstrated no fluoride release or degradation after the growth period (Figure S4). Each spectrum ranges from δ −66.5 to
−121.0 ppm with axis breaks (//) removing regions where no peaks were detected.

ophospholipids were identified and quantified in strain 273 cells
grown with polyfluorinated decanes. Fluorinated phosphatidylcholines (PCs) were in highest relative abundance in F2-decanegrown cells (Figure 4A). The relative abundance of fluorinated
lipids decreased in the order F2-decane > F3-decane > F5decane) indicating a shift in fluorinated glycerophospholipid
incorporation into the membrane bilayer with respect to the
degree of fluorination of the growth substrate (Figure 4). With
F2-decane as growth substrate, 37.0% of all detected
glycerophospholipids possess two fluorine substitutions on a
single acyl chain (difluorinated glycerophospholipid species)
with an additional 9.10% possessing two fluorine substitutions
on each of the sn1 and sn2 acyl chains (tetrafluorinated
glycerophospholipid species) (Figure 4A). Total organofluorine
incorporation decreased to 12.8% in cells grown with F3-decane
with single fluoroacyl chains detected and hexafluorination (i.e.,
three fluorine substitutions on each of the sn1 and sn2 acyl
chains) was not observed. Of all fluorinated decane growth
substrates, organofluorine incorporation into the lipidome was
lowest in cells grown with F5-decane (3.70%) with glycerFigure 3. 19F NMR analysis of medium amended with F5-hexanoate +

ophospholipids possibly possessing a single or two pentafluorinated acyl chains observed based on retention time and m/z.
Comparative analyses revealed an uneven distribution of
organofluorine incorporation throughout the lipidome (i.e.,
fluorination of different glycerophospholipid classes), relative to
the degree of fluorine substitution on the fluorinated decane
growth substrate (Figure 4). Organofluorine incorporation
preference is exemplified for strain 273 cells grown with F2decane, demonstrating a higher abundance of di- and
tetrafluorinated phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) compared to PC (Figure 4A). More
specifically, the combination of PG-F4 and PG-F2 (6.50%)
accounted for a slightly higher percent abundance than
nonfluorinated PG (6.00%) for F2-decane grown cells (Figure
1A). Similarly, the relative abundance of fluorinated PEs
(∼30.0%) to nonfluorinated PEs (∼30.0%) was equal (Figure
1A). However, organofluorine glycerophospholipid preference
is observed for PC, with more nonfluorinated PCs (∼18.0%)
than fluorinated PCs (PC-F2 + PC-F4; 10%) being detected. For
F3-decane-grown cells, PGs were the most frequently detected
fluorinated glycerophospholipid, despite being the least
abundant glycerophospholipid class (Figure 4B). OrganoFigure 5. UHPLC-MS/HRMS analysis of glycerophospholipid extracts from strain 273 cells grown with F2-decane, F3-decane, or F5-decane. Panel A
shows the mass spectrum and identification of a tetrafluorinated PE (34:1)-F4 (negative mode) from F2-decane-grown cells, demonstrating
difluorination of both the sn1 (C18:1-F2) and the sn2 (C16:0-F2) acyl chains. Panel B shows the mass spectrum and identification of a trifluorinated PE
(34:1)-F3 (negative mode) from F3-decane-grown cells, demonstrating a trifluorinated methyl group on the sn2 acyl chain. Panel C shows the mass
spectrum and identification of PE (32:1)-F5 in lipid extracts from F5-decane-grown cells, demonstrating incorporation of a pentafluorine moiety on a
single acyl chain. Panel D shows the mass spectrum and identification of PE (32:2)-F10 (negative mode) from F5-decane-grown cells, demonstrating
incorporation of a pentafluorine moiety on both acyl chains can occur. Positions of unsaturations and organofluorine group distribution between sn1
and sn2 acyl chains are unknown, and the lipid structures are representations of possible configurations. Specific fatty acyl chain lengths in panels C and
D are inferred from the preference of strain 273 to produce the nonfluorinated analogues of these fatty acids. Unlabeled peaks could represent
unidentified glycerophospholipids or fragments of glycerophospholipids, such as the headgroup.

fluorine incorporation preference during growth with F5-decane
was not apparent, presumably due to the low overall abundance
of acyl chains with pentafluorination (Figure 4C).
Utilizing Method RP, multiple fluorinated glycerophospholipids were classified by retention time, exact mass (±5 ppm) to
constrain the formulas and predict combined fatty acyl tail
length, and fragmentation data, if available, to identify specific
fatty acyl tail moieties. The UHPLC-HRMS measurements
identified compounds with m/z ratios consistent with
difluorinated sn1/sn2 acyl chains in cells grown with F2-decane
(Figure 5A). The UHPLC-MS/HRMS fragmentation data for
samples from F2-decane-grown strain 273 cells indicate that
glycerophospholipids can possess a maximum of four organofluorine substitutions by incorporating two organofluorines on
both the sn1 and sn2 acyl chains (Figure 5A). Similarly, the
UHPLC-MS/HRMS data for samples from F3-decane-grown
cells possess m/z ratios consistent with a single trifluoromethyl
group located on the sn1 or the sn2 acyl chain (Figure 5B).
These results suggest strain 273 can incorporate a single
trifluoromethyl group into a glycerophospholipid when grown
with F3-decane. Hexafluorinated glycerophospholipids (i.e.,
each acyl chain carrying a trifluoromethyl group) were not
observed in cells grown with F3-decane. UHPLC-MS/HRMS
analysis of samples from cells grown with F5-decane identified
glycerophospholipid classes with both five and ten fluorine
substitutions, albeit in low abundances (Figure 5C,D).
Fragmentation of sn1/sn2 acyl chains (Method RP) could not
be achieved for highly fluorinated lipids due to their low relative
abundances in cells grown with F5-decane, and the identification
of these molecules was based on expected retention time and
exact mass (±5 ppm, Figure 5C,D).
■DISCUSSION
Despite the recalcitrance reported for many fluorinated
xenobiotics, microbial degradation and defluorination of
fluorinated compounds has been observed.12,31−37 Recent
work demonstrated that some Pseudomonas spp. possess a
unique alkane monooxygenase (AlkB) enzyme system comprising the catalytic AlkB component and a fused ferredoxin -
ferredoxin reductase that is involved in the initial attack on
terminally monofluorinated alkanes.16 Interestingly, some
defluorinating AlkB enzyme systems have a preference for
terminal −CH2F over the −CH3 group, suggesting they are alkyl
fluoride dehalogenases.15,17,18 When Pseudomonas sp. strain 273
was challenged with F2-decane or F3-decane, growth occurred
but fluoride release was minimal, suggesting that terminal
difluorination (−CF2H) or perfluorination (−CF3) directs the
initial AlkB attack to the nonfluorinated end of the fluoroalkane
growth substrate. Growth with F2-decane demonstrated that
one additional fluorine substitution at the C1 carbon (−CF2H)
compared to −CH2F directs the AlkB attack to the nonfluorinated terminal −CH3 group, with <1% of the total fluorine
released as inorganic fluoride. Terminal perfluorination (i.e.,
−CF3 group) fully directs the AlkB attack to the nonfluorinated
methyl group terminal position (ω-carbon), as demonstrated for
F3-decane and F5-decane as growth substrates.
Figure 6. Proposed pathway for the catabolic conversion of F5-decane to F3-butanoate in Pseudomonas sp. strain 273. AlkB-2 oxidizes F5-decane to
9,9,10,10,10-pentafluorodecan-1-ol, which is further oxidized via the aldehyde to the carboxylate. Two cycles of β-oxidation result in the formation of
F5-hexanoate, which undergoes activation at the β carbon followed by HF elimination. Two subsequent oxidation/hydrogenation reactions liberate
inorganic fluoride from the perfluorinated δ-carbon (−CF2−) and yield 6,6,6-trifluoro-3-oxohexanoate, which undergoes one additional cycle of βoxidation to form F3-butanoate. The proposed pathway generates inorganic fluoride and F3-butanoate in a 2:1 ratio, consistent with the experimental
observations during growth of strain 273 with F5-decane + decanoate. The letters X and Y represent unknown hydrogen/electron carriers. Under in
vivo conditions, the deprotonated carboxylates exist as CoA thioesters (“R”).

## Page 9

Strain 273 possesses three alkB gene clusters, and it is possible
that different or multiple alkB genes are active during growth
with F2-decane, F3-decane, and F5-decane; however, a genomewide expression analysis has demonstrated that during growth
with decane and terminally monofluorinated decanes, a single
AlkB (i.e., AlkB-2) which couples with a fused ferredoxin -
ferredoxin reductase is expressed.16 Therefore, it is likely that
AlkB-2 is responsible for the initial attack on F2-decane, F3decane, and F5-decane. Albeit with low efficiency, AlkB-2 can
directly attack the −CF2H group of F2-decane leading to the
formation of a halohydrin followed by spontaneous release of
one fluorine substituent. In contrast, no fluoride release is
observed with F3-decane because direct oxidation of the
terminal −CF3 group by AlkB-2 is not possible, and β-oxidation
does not produce a transformation product with a carbonyl
moiety positioned three atoms away from the −CF3 group,
which could allow enolization and subsequent fluoride
elimination to occur. Although AlkB-2 cannot attack a −CF3
group, defluorination was observed during growth with F5decane and likely occurred during the catabolism of shorterchain fatty acids discussed below. AlkB-2 oxidizes F5-decane to
10,10,10,9,9-pentafluorodecanol, and the alcohol is further
oxidized to the carboxylate, activated to its CoA thioester, and
then undergoes two cycles of β-oxidation to yield F5-hexanoate.
A third cycle of β-oxidation would lead to the formation of
3,3,4,4,4-pentafluorobutanoate; however, the formation of this
compound was not observed with F5-decane as the sole growth
substrate, possibly because this compound is short-lived and
evades detection. Alternatively, a pentafluorinated product of βoxidation (F5-hexanoate) necessary to produce 3,3,4,4,4pentafluorobutanoate undergoes defluorination before conversion to a four-carbon fatty acid. Further transformation of
F5-hexanoate and a compound similar in chemical shift to F3hexanoate (tentatively annotated as 6,6,6-trifluoro-3-oxohexanoate) was observed in cultures that received decanoate as an
additional growth substrate. Presumably the perfluorinated δcarbon of F5-hexanoate is defluorinated to this trifluorinated
metabolite, indicating a heretofore unrecognized defluorination
capability of strain 273. Following the defluorination of F5hexanoate to 6,6,6-trifluoro-3-oxohexanoate one additional
cycle of β-oxidation can occur resulting in the formation of
F3-butanoate. Of the 2.70 ± 0.255 mM F5-decane consumed
when grown with decanoate, 1.44 ± 0.470 mM (54.4 ± 17.4%)
was recovered as F3-butanoate. The enzyme(s) and/or abiotic
reaction(s) that convert F5-hexanoate to F3-hexanoate (i.e.,
defluorination at the δ-carbon) act(s) on a perfluorinated
carbon (−CF2−) adjacent to a perfluorinated terminal carbon
(−CF3) remain uncharacterized and should be a focus of future
investigations. Experimental measurements of carboxylic acids
generated from the proposed pathway intermediates and
products suggest a biotransformation pathway for F5-decane
that produces shorter chain organic acids with fewer fluorines
(Figure 6). Notably, the proposed steps of this particular
transformation can potentially be accomplished via enzymes
needed for fatty acid metabolism of nonfluorinated metabolites.
A similar pathway has been proposed in a study that
investigated reactivity relationships in the aerobic defluorination
of terminally trifluorinated C3 and C5 short chain fatty acids by
activated sludge communities.38 Proposed pathways for the
transformation of PFASs often include defluorination of the
internal −CF2−carbon adjacent to the nonfluorinated −CH2−
carbon. Such biotransformation of the −CF2−group has been
observed in sludge and soil microcosms, as well as pure culture
incubations with fluorotelomer alcohols [FTOHs, F-
(CF2)nCH2CH2OH, n = 4, 6, 8], where the defluorination of
multiple −CF2−groups can result in the formation of shorter
chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs).39−42 Apparently, enzymes catalyzing the defluorination of internal
perfluorinated −CF2−carbons are more broadly distributed,
and not a unique feature of Pseudomonas sp. strain 273. A prior
study observed the microbial biotransformation of aqueous filmforming foam- (AFFF-) derived polyfluoroalkyl substances to
8:2 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (FTCA), followed by a
dehydrohalogenation step involving the loss of the first fluorine
at the β-carbon (−CF2−) and one hydrogen from the adjacent
carbon (−CH2−), resulting in the formation of 8:2
fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acid (FTUCA).41 The
8:2 FTUCA then undergoes another attack by water at the βcarbon, resulting in the loss of the second fluorine substituent via
Michael addition/elimination leading to the formation of a
carbonyl. We propose a reaction sequence similar to the above
transformation for the conversion of F5-hexanoate to 6,6,6trifluoro-3-oxohexanoate(Figure 6).41 Characterizing these
defluorinating enzyme systems should be a priority goal, as it
could advance understanding of the mechanisms and pathways
transforming polyfluoroalkyl substances.
19F NMR Demonstrates Utility for Tracing Fluorinated
Catabolites. Fluorine is a monoisotopic element and has a high
magnetogyric ratio with a large chemical shift range of δ > 350
ppm, resulting in well separated resonances of individual
fluorine nuclei in a polyfluorinated compound.43,44 The nuclear
spin quantum number of fluorine is 1/2, and thus fluorine can
couple to proximate protons and carbon atoms in characteristic
manners that allow for extensive structure elucidation.45
Terminal −CF3 groups of n-alkanes generally absorb near δ
−68 ppm on
19F NMR.46 Fluorinated carboxylic group
derivatives generally have little difference in chemical shift,
and detection occurs between δ −63 to −76 ppm.46 Such
chemical properties explain the proximity of the F3-hexanoate
standard (δ −66.8 ppm, triplet) and the detected trifluorinated
metabolite (presumably 6,6,6-trifluoro-3-oxohexanoate) (δ
−66.9 ppm, triplet) NMR signals. The 19F NMR experiments
conducted in this study also corroborate the utility of this
spectroscopic technique for absolute quantification of inorganic
fluoride, as well as the identification of polyfluorinated
metabolites.47
Polyfluorinated Catabolites Enter Fatty Acid Biosynthesis. Incorporation of organofluorine into the lipidome has
been demonstrated in strain 273 cells grown with 1fluorodecane or 1,10-difluorodecane.18 Here, we show that
organofluorine metabolites with poly- and perfluorinated
carbons can also be channeled into phospholipid biosynthesis
and the lipidome. Lipidomic profiling determined that the
relative abundance of fluorinated lipids decreases as the degree
of fluorination of the growth substrates increases from F2decane (46.1%) →F3-decane (12.8%) →F5-decane (3.70%).
These decreasing relative abundances of fluorinated glycerophospholipids suggest a shift in fluorinated glycerophospholipid incorporation into the membrane bilayer with respect to
the degree of fluorination on the growth substrate. A prior study
with Pseudomonas sp. strain 273 grown with 1,10-difluorodecane
found that up to 82% of the total detected glycerophospholipids
carry a single fluorine substitution in one or both sn1/sn2 acyl
chains. The experimental work described herein demonstrates
that the degree of fluorination on the initial substrate impacts the
synthesis of long-chain fluorinated fatty acids. Assuming

fluorinated fatty acid synthesis proceeds through fluoroacetylacyl carrier proteins, it is possible that monofluoroacetyl-CoA is
converted with higher efficiency than di- and trifluoroacetylCoAs (i.e., di- and trifluoroacetyl-CoAs are inferior substrates
for fatty acid biosynthesis compared to monofluoroacetyl-CoA).
A recent study found that bacteria may possess CoA ligases with
higher affinity to fluorinated fatty acids (e.g., 1:5, 2:4, and 3:3
FTCAs) than to the nonfluorinated counterparts.48 It is
currently unclear if the enzymes involved in de novo fatty acid
biosynthesis prefer the fluorinated versus nonfluorinated
substrates, warranting kinetic studies to reveal if organofluorine
incorporation into glycerophospholipids is due to enzyme
promiscuity or involves enzymes with higher affinity to shortchains fluorinated than nonfluorinated fatty acids.
Pathways Leading to the Formation of Pentafluorinated Acyl Chains. De novo fatty acid biosynthesis is an
iterative process initiated with acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA as
building blocks.49−53 The formation of fluoroacetyl-CoAs is a
plausible explanation (i.e., entry point) for fluorinated fatty acid
biosynthesis, as speculated in prior studies16,18 However, the
observed formation of penta- and decafluorinated glycerophospholipids measured in strain 273 cells grown with F5-decane
cannot be explained with trifluoroacetyl-CoA serving as an initial
building block, due to the origin of the −CF2−group within the
sn1/sn2 acyl chains of the detected glycerophospholipids.
Longer-chain length acyl-CoAs, such as pentafluorohexanoylCoA, pentafluorooctanoyl-CoA, and pentafluorodecanoyl-CoA,
may be directly shunted into fatty acid synthesis. Such a
mechanism is not unprecedented, and bacteria have been
reported to directly shunt β-oxidation intermediates (e.g.,
octanoyl-CoA) into de novo fatty acid biosynthesis.54,55
Percent Fluorination Alters Membrane Lipid Composition. Even though bacteria have comparatively simple
membranes, they synthesize a diverse set of fatty acids with
varying degrees of unsaturations that result in several
glycerophospholipid classes, each with multiple species, that
allow adaptation to fluctuating environmental conditions.56,57
Many studies have investigated the metabolism of fatty acids and
glycerophospholipid classes via the application of stable isotope
labeling through enrichment via the substrate pool.58−60
Historically, a single fluorine has been considered a rather
innocent isostere for hydrogen due to their relatively similar
sizes, but the extent to which the chemical properties of carbons
bearing multiple fluorines deviate from hydrocarbons is
underappreciated.61 Further, fluorination of the termini of
glycerophospholipid tails and close packing of molecules in the
membrane could also force interaction among highly electronegative moieties, which could increase the fluorous effect and
lead to phase separation in the membrane.62 This effect could
explain the observation that ∼46% of detected glycerophospholipids were fluorinated when grown with F2-decane while
only ∼13% of detected glycerophospholipids were fluorinated
when grown with F3-decane and ∼4% of detected glycerophospholipids were fluorinated when grown with F5-decane
(Figures 4 and 6). Membranes with a high percentage of
fluorination among the glycerophospholipids also had a higher
percentage of PE (Figure 4), which was observed previously
with strain 273.15 These findings add to a growing understanding that bacteria can alter glycerophospholipid class
composition in response to environmental stimuli.63−65
Alterations in the acyl chain composition impacts membrane
fluidity, and bacteria are known to adapt to a number of
environmental stimuli, such as temperature,66 and changes in
acyl chain composition were detected under all growth
conditions in this study (Figure 5). The global lipidome changes
triggered by the incorporation of fluorinated glycerophospholipids observed in strain 273 suggest that these molecules could
impact microbial community function and structure in environmental systems and have other unanticipated ecological or
ecotoxicological effects. The ecological or ecotoxicological
effects of such global lipidome changes (i.e., fluoromembrane
formation) are unclear and warrant exploration. Future work
should assess other bacteria with AlkB-2 type alkyl fluoride
dehalogenases (e.g., Pseudomonas spp., Fontimonas sp.)16,17 for
their ability to catabolize terminally polyfluorinated decanes and
whether the asymmetric distribution of organofluorine incorporation into glycerophospholipid classes is a shared feature.
Implications for the Study of PFAS Biotransformation.
Work presented herein demonstrates that polyfluoroalkyl
substances with nonfluorinated α-, β-, and γ-carbons (or
more) are susceptible to partial β-oxidation, which can support
bacterial growth. Polyfluorinated fatty acids undergo βoxidation and δ carbon defluorination (e.g., conversion of F5hexanoate to F3-hexanaote), allowing additional cycles of βoxidation and chain shortening. This type of reaction has been
proposed in fluorotelomer biotransformation pathways,67,68 and
the identification of the enzymes involved should have a high
priority for advancing mechanistic understanding and potentially developing biomarkers. Enzymes with specificity for
perfluorinated −CF2−group defluorination could enable
gene-, transcript-, protein, and/or metabolite-centric approaches to probe PFAS-contaminated environments for
defluorination, a useful measure to document natural attenuation potential and to potentially aid environmental risk
assessment. The observation that Pseudomonas sp. strain 273
metabolizes terminally polyfluorinated decanes demonstrates
that available axenic cultures are resources to derive mechanistic
understanding of processes underlying biotransformation and
fate of environmentally relevant PFASs.
