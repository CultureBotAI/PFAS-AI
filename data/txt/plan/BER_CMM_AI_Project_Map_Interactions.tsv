AI WP 1: Predictive Phenotype Modeling	Provides predictions for engineered strain performance to guide design choices.	Uses bioprocess data for model validation at scale.	Provides context for interpreting gene expression changes.	Uses kinetic data to parameterize mechanistic models (GEMs).	INPUT: Consumes high-throughput data for model training and validation.
AI WP 2: Multi-Omics Integration	Receives engineered strains for 'omics' analysis.	Provides systems-level explanation for bioprocess outcomes.	INPUT: Consumes transcriptomic/proteomic data for network inference. OUTPUT: Delivers novel gene targets for validation.	Provides functional context for newly identified proteins.	Correlates gene networks with specific phenotypes.
AI WP 3: AI-Guided Strain Design	OUTPUT: Delivers ranked, multi-gene engineering strategies for implementation.	Defines the objective function (e.g., maximize yield) for in silico evolution.	Identifies key regulatory nodes to target for engineering.	"Provides performance parameters for the ""digital twin"" model."	Predicts phenotypes of novel, untested genetic designs.
AI WP 4: Knowledge Synthesis	Integrates engineering outcomes into a project-wide knowledge base.	Links bioprocess performance to community-level ecological models.	INPUT: Consumes all 'omics' data. OUTPUT: Generates novel, systems-level hypotheses for testing across scales.	Integrates enzyme data into a broader biological context.	Connects single-organism phenotypes to multi-species interaction models.
